It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.     \nHowever, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.  \nAnd how can you do that?  \nUniversities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)  \nMost online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture  \nThe Solution  \nThe Solution\nData science is a multidisciplinary field.

And you risk getting lost along the way if you don\u2019t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.  \nSo, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2020.  \nSo, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2020.\nSo, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2020.\nWe believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field \u2013 having all the necessary resources in one place.  \n\u2013 having all the necessary resources in one place.\nMoreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other.

As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This \u2018Intro to data and data science\u2019 will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.  \nWhy learn it?\n   2. Mathematics \n2. Mathematics\nLearning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.  \nWe take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.  \nWhy learn it?  \nWhy learn it?\nCalculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.\n   3. Statistics \n3. Statistics\nYou need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist.  \nWhy learn it?  \nWhy learn it?\nThis course doesn\u2019t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.\n   4. Python\n4. Python\nPython is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That\u2019s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.\nWhy learn it?  \nWhy learn it?\nWhen it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language.  \n   5. Tableau\n5. Tableau\nData scientists don\u2019t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data\u2019s story in a way they will understand. That\u2019s where Tableau comes in \u2013 and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.\nWhy learn it?  \nWhy learn it?\nA data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers.  \n   6. Advanced Statistics \n6. Advanced Statistics\nRegressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail.  \nWhy learn it?  \nWhy learn it?\nData science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this \u2018advance statistics\u2019 section.  \n   7. Machine Learning \n7. Machine Learning\nThe final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data scientist from a data analyst. This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow.  \nscientist\nanalyst.\nWhy learn it?  \nWhy learn it?\nMachine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for you to control the machines.  \nyou\n***What you get***\n***What you get***\nA $1250 data science training program  \nActive Q&A support  \nAll the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist  \nA community of data science learners  \nA certificate of completion  \nAccess to future updates  \nSolve real-life business cases that will get you the job   \nA $1250 data science training program  \nA $1250 data science training program  \nActive Q&A support  \nActive Q&A support  \nAll the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist  \nAll the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist  \nA community of data science learners  \nA community of data science learners  \nA certificate of completion  \nA certificate of completion  \nAccess to future updates  \nAccess to future updates  \nSolve real-life business cases that will get you the job   \nSolve real-life business cases that will get you the job   \nYou will become a data scientist from scratch  \nYou will become a data scientist from scratch\nWe are happy to offer an unconditional 30-day money back in full guarantee.

one of the fastest growing. His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.\nHaving been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.  Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.\nAndrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.\nTaking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.\nSee you inside the courses!\n\nA self-taught Machine Learning Engineer who lives on the internet with an uncurable desire to take long walks and fill up blank pages.\nMy experience in machine learning comes from working at one of Australia's fastest-growing artificial intelligence agencies, Max Kelsen.\nI've worked on machine learning and data problems across a wide range of industries including healthcare, eCommerce, finance, retail and more.\nTwo of my favourite projects include building a machine learning model to extract information from doctors notes for one of Australia's leading medical research facilities, as well as building a natural language model to assess insurance claims for one of Australia's largest insurance groups.\nDue to the performance of the natural language model (a model which reads insurance claims and decides which party is at fault),  the insurance company were able to reduce their daily assessment load by up to 2,500 claims.\nMy long-term goal is to combine my knowledge of machine learning and my background in nutrition to work towards answering the question \"what should I eat?\".\nAside from building machine learning models on my own, I love writing about and making videos on the process. My articles and videos on machine learning on Medium, personal blog and YouTube have collectively received over 5-million views.\nI love nothing more than a complicated topic explained in an entertaining and educative matter. I know what it's like to try and learn a new topic, online and on your own. So I pour my soul into making sure my creations are accessible as possible.\nMy modus operandi (a fancy term for my way of doing things) is learning to create and creating to learn.

Imagine a world with drastically reduced car accidents, simply by removing the element of human error.\nGoogle famously announced that they are now \"machine learning first\", meaning that machine learning is going to get a lot more attention now, and this is what's going to drive innovation in the coming years. It's embedded into all sorts of different products.\nMachine learning is used in many industries, like finance, online advertising, medicine, and robotics.\nIt is a widely applicable tool that will benefit you no matter what industry you're in, and it will also open up a ton of career opportunities once you get good.\nMachine learning also raises some philosophical questions. Are we building a machine that can think? What does it mean to be conscious? Will computers one day take over the world?\nIn this course, we are first going to discuss the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. It\u2019s extremely simple and intuitive, and it\u2019s a great first classification algorithm to learn. After we discuss the concepts and implement it in code, we\u2019ll look at some ways in which KNN can fail.\nK-Nearest Neighbor\nIt\u2019s important to know both the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm we look at.\nNext we\u2019ll look at the Naive Bayes Classifier and the General Bayes Classifier. This is a very interesting algorithm to look at because it is grounded in probability.\nNaive Bayes\nWe\u2019ll see how we can transform the Bayes Classifier into a linear and quadratic classifier to speed up our calculations.\nNext we\u2019ll look at the famous Decision Tree algorithm. This is the most complex of the algorithms we\u2019ll study, and most courses you\u2019ll look at won\u2019t implement them. We will, since I believe implementation is good practice.\nDecision Tree\nThe last algorithm we\u2019ll look at is the Perceptron algorithm. Perceptrons are the ancestor of neural networks and deep learning, so they are important to study in the context of machine learning.\nPerceptron\nneural networks\ndeep learning\nOne we\u2019ve studied these algorithms, we\u2019ll move to more practical machine learning topics. Hyperparameters, cross-validation, feature extraction, feature selection, and multiclass classification.\nHyperparameters\ncross-validation\nfeature extraction\nfeature selection\nWe\u2019ll do a comparison with deep learning so you understand the pros and cons of each approach.\nWe\u2019ll discuss the Sci-Kit Learn library, because even though implementing your own algorithms is fun and educational, you should use optimized and well-tested code in your actual work.\nSci-Kit Learn\nWe\u2019ll cap things off with a very practical, real-world example by writing a web service that runs a machine learning model and makes predictions. This is something that real companies do and make money from.\nweb service\nAll the materials for this course are FREE.

If you're doing data analytics automating pattern recognition in your data would be invaluable.\ndata analytics\nThis is where unsupervised machine learning comes into play.\nIn this course we are first going to talk about clustering.

In many Data Science and Machine Learning courses, algorithms are taught without teaching Python or such programming language. However, it is very important to understand the construct of the language in order to implement any discipline including Data Science and Machine Learning.\nAlso, without understanding the Mathematics and Statistics it's impossible to understand how some of the Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms and techniques work.\nData Science and Machine Learning is a complex set of topics which are interlinked. However, we firmly believe in what Einstein once said,\nEinstein once said,\n\"If you can not explain it simply, you have not understood it enough.\"\n\"If you can not explain it simply, you have not understood it enough.\"\nAs an instructor, I always try my level best to live up to this principle. This is one comprehensive course on Data Science and Machine Learning that teaches you everything required to learn Data Science and Machine Learning using the simplest examples with great depth.\nThis is one comprehensive course on Data Science and Machine Learning that teaches you everything required to learn Data Science and Machine Learning using the simplest examples with great depth\nAs you will see from the preview lectures, some of the most complex topics are explained in a simple language.\nSome of the key skills you will learn,\nSome of the key skills you will learn,\nPython Programming\nPython has been ranked as the #1 language for Data Science and Machine Learning. It is easy to use and is rich with various libraries and functions required for performing various tasks for Data Science and Machine Learning. Moreover, it is the most preferred and default language of use for many Deep Learning frameworks including Tensorflow and Keras.\n\nAdvance Mathematics for Machine Learning\nMathematics is the very basis for Data Science in general and Machine Learning in particular. Without understanding the meanings of Vectors, Matrices, their operations as well as understanding Calculus, it is not possible to understand the foundation of the Data Science and Machine Learning. Gradient Descent which forms the very basis of Neural Network and Machine Learning is built upon the basics of Calculus and Derivatives.\n\nAdvance Statistics for Data Science\nIt is not enough to know only mean, median, mode etc. The advance techniques of Data Science and Machine Learning such as Feature Selection, Dimensionality Reduction using PCA are all based on advance inferential statistics of Distributions and Statistical Significance. It also helps us understanding the data behavior and then apply an appropriate machine learning technique to get the best result from various techniques of Data Science and Machine Learning.\n\nData Visualization\nAs they say, picture is worth a thousand words. Data Visualization is one of the key techniques of Data Science and Machine Learning and is used for Exploratory Data Analysis. In that, we visually analyse the data to identify the patterns and trends. We are going to learn how to create various plots and charts as well as how to analyse them for all the practical purposes. Feature Selection plays a key role in Machine Learning and Data Visualisation is key for it.\n\nData Processing\nData Science require extensive data processing. Data Science and Machine Learning practitioners spend more than 2\/3rd of the time processing and analysing the data. Data can be noisy and is never in the best shape and form. Data Processing is one of the key disciplines of Data Science and Machine Learning to get the best results. We will be using Pandas which is the most popular library for data processing in Python and various other libraries to read, analyse, process and clean the data.\n\nMachine Learning\nThe heart and soul of Data Science is the predictive ability provided by the algorithms from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Machine Learning takes the overall discipline of Data Science ahead of others. We will combine everything we would learn from the previous sections and build various machine learning models. The key aspects of the Machine Learning is not just about the algorithms but also understanding various parameters used by Machine Learning algorithms. We will understand all the key parameters and how their values impact the outcome so that you can build the best machine learning models.\n\nFeature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction\nIn case you wonder, what makes a good data scientists, then this section is the answer. A good Data Science and Machine Learning practitioner does not just use libraries and code few lines. She will analyse every feature of the data objectively and choose the most relevant ones based on statistical analysis. We will learn how to reduce the number of features as well as how we can retain the value in the data when we practice and build various machine learning models after applying the principles of Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction using PCA.\n\nDeep Learning\nYou can not become a good Data Science and Machine Learning practitioner, if you do not know how to build powerful neural network. Deep Learning can be said to be another kind of Machine Learning with great power and flexibility. After Learning Machine Learning, we are going to learn some key fundamentals of Deep Learning and build a solid foundation first. We will then use Keras and Tensorflow which are the most popular Deep Learning frameworks in the world.\n\nKaggle Project\nAs an aspiring Data Scientists, we always wish to work on Kaggle project for Machine Learning and achieve good results.

We will install and configure anaconda which is a platform you can use for quick and easy installation of python and its libraries. We will get ourselves familiar with Jupiter notebook, which is the IDE that we are using throughout this course for python coding.\n\n\nThen we will go ahead with the basic python data types like strings, numbers and its operations. We will deal with different types of ways to assign and access strings, string slicing, replacement, concatenation, formatting and f strings.\n\n\nDealing with numbers, we will discuss the assignment, accessing and different operations with integers and floats. The operations include basic ones and also advanced ones like exponents. Also we will check the order of operations, increments and decrements, rounding values and type casting.\n\n\nThen we will proceed with basic data structures in python like Lists tuples and set. For lists, we will try different assignment, access and slicing options. Along with popular list methods, we will also see list extension, removal, reversing, sorting, min and max, existence check , list looping, slicing, and also inter-conversion of list and strings.\n\n\nFor Tuples also we will do the assignment and access options and the proceed with different options with set in python.\n\n\nAfter that, we will deal with python dictionaries. Different assignment and access methods. Value update and delete methods and also looping through the values in the dictionary.\n\n\nAnd after learning all of these basic data types and data structures, its time for us to proceed with the popular libraries for data-science in python. We will start with the NumPy library. We will check different ways to create a new NumPy array, reshaping , transforming list to arrays, zero arrays and one arrays, different array operations, array indexing, slicing, copying. we will also deal with creating and reshaping multi dimensional NumPy arrays, array transpose, and statistical operations like mean variance etc using NumPy\n\n\nLater we will go ahead with the next popular python library called Pandas. At first we will deal with the one dimensional labelled array in pandas called as the series.  We will create assign and access the series using different methods.\n\n\nThen will go ahead with the Pandas Data frames, which is a 2-dimensional labelled data structure with columns of potentially different types. We will convert NumPy arrays and also pandas series to data frames. We will try column wise and row wise access options, dropping rows and columns, getting the summary of data frames with methods like min, max etc. Also we will convert a python dictionary into a pandas data frame. In large datasets, its common to have empty or missing data. We will see how we can manage missing data within dataframes. We will see sorting and indexing operations for data frames.\n\n\nMost times, external data will be coming in either a CSV file or a JSON file. We will check how we can import CSV and JSON file data as a dataframe so that we can do the operations and later convert this data frame to either CSV and json objects and write it into the respective files. \n\n\nAlso we will see how we can concatenate, join and merge two pandas data frames. Then we will deal with data stacking and pivoting using the data frame and also to deal with duplicate values within the data-frame and to remove them selectively.\n\n\nWe can group data within a data-frame using group by methods for pandas data frame. We will check the steps we need to follow for grouping. Similarly we can do aggregation of data in the data-frame using different methods available and also using custom functions. We will also see other grouping techniques like Binning and bucketing based on data in the data-frame\n\n\nAt times we may need to use custom indexing for our dataframe. We will see methods to re-index rows and columns of a dataframe and also rename column indexes and rows. We will also check methods to do collective replacement of values in a dataframe and also to find the count of all or unique values in a dataframe.\n\n\nThen we will proceed with implementing random permutation using both the NumPy and Pandas library and the steps to follow. Since an excelsheet and a dataframe are similar 2d arrays, we will see how we can load values in a dataframe from an excelsheet by parsing it. Then we will do condition based selection of values in a dataframe, also by using lambda functions and also finding rank based on columns.\n\n\nThen we will go ahead with cross Tabulation of our dataframe using contingency tables. The steps we need to proceed with to create the cross tabulation contingency table.\n\n\nAfter all these operations in the data we have, now its time to visualize the data. We will do exercises in which we can generate graphs and plots. We will be using another popular python library called Matplotlib to generate graphs and plots. We will do tweaking of the grpahs and plots by adjusting the plot types, its parameters, labels, titles etc.\n\n\nThen we will use another visualization option called histogram which can be used to groups numbers into ranges. We will also be trying different options provided by matplotlib library for histogram\n\n\nOverall this course is a perfect starter pack for your long journey ahead with big data and machine learning. You will also be getting an experience certificate after the completion of the course(only if your learning platform supports)\n\n\nSo lets start with the lessons. See you soon in the class room.\nWho this course is for:\nData science enthusiasts who want to begin their career","number_of_lectures":"63 lectures","total_video_duration":"06:20:15","lectures_breakdown":[["Course Introduction and Table of Contents","Preview\n09:29"],["Introduction to Python, Pandas and Numpy","06:53"],["System and Environment Setup","Preview\n08:25"],["Python Strings - Part 1","10:46"],["Python Strings - Part 2","08:50"],["Python Numbers and Operators - Part 1","06:29"],["Python Numbers and Operators - Part 2","06:59"],["Python Lists - Part 1","05:08"],["Python Lists - Part 2","06:07"],["Python Lists - Part 3","05:28"],["Python Lists - Part 4","06:53"],["Python Lists - Part 5","07:27"],["Tuples in Python","05:35"],["Sets in Python - Part 1","05:00"],["Sets in Python - Part 2","03:58"],["Python Dictionary - Part 1","06:35"],["Python Dictionary - Part 2","06:54"],["NumPy Library Intro - Part 1","04:51"],["NumPy Library Intro - Part 2","05:25"],["NumPy Library Intro - Part 3","06:27"],["NumPy Array Operations and Indexing - Part 1","04:10"],["NumPy Array Operations and Indexing - Part 2","05:34"],["NumPy Multi-Dimensional Arrays - Part 1","07:15"],["NumPy Multi-Dimensional Arrays - Part 2","05:33"],["NumPy Multi-Dimensional Arrays - Part 3","05:18"],["Introduction to Pandas Series","08:09"],["Introduction to Pandas Dataframes","07:07"],["Pandas Dataframe conversion and drop - Part 1","06:15"],["Pandas Dataframe conversion and drop - Part 2","05:34"],["Pandas Dataframe conversion and drop - Part 3","07:13"],["Pandas Dataframe summary and selection - Part 1","05:45"],["Pandas Dataframe summary and selection - Part 2","05:30"],["Pandas Dataframe summary and selection - Part 3","06:58"],["Pandas Missing Data Management and Sorting - Part 1","06:37"],["Pandas Missing Data Management and Sorting - Part 2","06:41"],["Pandas Hierarchical-Multi Indexing","05:56"],["Pandas CSV File Read Write - Part 1","05:28"],["Pandas CSV File Read Write - Part 2","06:51"],["Pandas JSON File Read Write Operations","06:41"],["Pandas Concatenation Merging and Joining - Part 1","04:39"],["Pandas Concatenation Merging and Joining - Part 2","04:15"],["Pandas Concatenation Merging and Joining - Part 3","04:22"],["Pandas Stacking and Pivoting - Part 1","05:22"],["Pandas Stacking and Pivoting - Part 2","06:12"],["Pandas Duplicate Data Management","07:19"],["Pandas Mapping","04:06"],["Pandas Groupby","05:45"],["Pandas Aggregation","08:33"],["Pandas Binning or Bucketing","07:35"],["Pandas Re-index and Rename - Part 1","04:04"],["Pandas Re-index and Rename - Part 2","04:56"],["Pandas Replace Values","04:36"],["Pandas Dataframe Metrics","06:48"],["Pandas Random Permutation","08:15"],["Pandas Excel sheet Import","07:13"],["Pandas Condition Selection and Lambda Function - Part 1","04:33"],["Pandas Condition Selection and Lambda Function - Part 2","04:50"],["Pandas Ranks Min Max","06:02"],["Pandas Cross Tabulation","06:31"],["Graphs and plots using Matplotlib - Part 1","06:24"],["Graphs and plots using Matplotlib - Part 2","02:17"],["Matplotlib Histograms","03:20"],["Source Code Download Link","00:03"]],"original_price":"$94.99","instructor_name":"Abhilash Nelson","instructor_bio":"I am a pioneering, talented and security-oriented Android\/iOS Mobile and PHP\/Python Web Developer Application Developer offering more than eight years\u2019 overall IT experience which involves designing, implementing, integrating, testing and supporting impact-full web and mobile applications.\nI am a Post Graduate Masters Degree holder in Computer Science and Engineering.\nMy experience with PHP\/Python Programming is an added advantage for server based Android and iOS Client Applications.","instructor_rating":"4.2","total_reviews":"759","total_students":"26,639","total_courses":"19","group_instructor_rating":null,"group_reviews":null,"group_students":null,"group_courses":null},{"link":"https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/course\/practical-data-science-using-python\/","title":"Python + Data Science : Practical Guide [13 Hours]","topics":"How to set up your Python environment, How to manipulate String & Variables with Python, How to use Booleans & Logical Operators with Python, How to use Functions & Packages with Python, How to use Pandas & Data Frames with Python, How to perform Data Visualization with Python, How to do Web Scraping with Python, The Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP), The Basics of Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning, And much more...","summary":"[NOTE: This course will be constantly updated & improved as per your feedback.

Following my previous course on logistic regression, we take this basic building block, and build full-on non-linear neural networks right out of the gate using Python and Numpy. All the materials for this course are FREE.\nartificial neural network\ndeep learning\nWe extend the previous binary classification model to multiple classes using the softmax function, and we derive the very important training method called \"backpropagation\" using first principles. I show you how to code backpropagation in Numpy, first \"the slow way\", and then \"the fast way\" using Numpy features.\nbackpropagation\nNext, we implement a neural network using Google's new TensorFlow library.\nYou should take this course if you are interested in starting your journey toward becoming a master at deep learning, or if you are interested in machine learning and data science in general. We go beyond basic models like logistic regression and linear regression and I show you something that automatically learns features.\nmachine learning\ndata science\nautomatically learns features\nThis course provides you with many practical examples so that you can really see how deep learning can be used on anything. Throughout the course, we'll do a course project, which will show you how to predict user actions on a website given user data like whether or not that user is on a mobile device, the number of products they viewed, how long they stayed on your site, whether or not they are a returning visitor, and what time of day they visited.\nAnother project at the end of the course shows you how you can use deep learning for facial expression recognition. Imagine being able to predict someone's emotions just based on a picture!\nAfter getting your feet wet with the fundamentals, I provide a brief overview of some of the newest developments in neural networks - slightly modified architectures and what they are used for.\nNOTE:\n\nIf you already know about softmax and backpropagation, and you want to skip over the theory and speed things up using more advanced techniques along with GPU-optimization, check out my follow-up course on this topic, Data Science: Practical Deep Learning Concepts in Theano and TensorFlow.\nalready\nData Science: Practical Deep Learning Concepts in Theano and TensorFlow\nI have other courses that cover more advanced topics, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Autoencoders, and more! But you want to be very comfortable with the material in this course before moving on to more advanced subjects.\nConvolutional Neural Networks\nRestricted Boltzmann Machines\nAutoencoders\nThis course focuses on \"how to build and understand\", not just \"how to use\". Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about \"remembering facts\", it's about \"seeing for yourself\" via experimentation. It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally.

The field is exploding with opportunities and career prospects. Machine\/Deep Learning techniques are widely used in several sectors nowadays such as banking, healthcare, transportation and technology.\n\n\nMachine learning is the study of algorithms that teach computers to learn from experience. Through experience (i.e.: more training data), computers can continuously improve their performance. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine learning that utilizes multi-layer Artificial Neural Networks. Deep Learning is inspired by the human brain and mimics the operation of biological neurons. A hierarchical, deep artificial neural network is formed by connecting multiple artificial neurons in a layered fashion. The more hidden layers added to the network, the more \u201cdeep\u201d the network will be, the more complex nonlinear relationships that can be modeled. Deep learning is widely used in self-driving cars, face and speech recognition, and healthcare applications.\nMachine learning\nMachine learning\nDeep Learning\nDeep Learning\n\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with knowledge of key aspects of deep and machine learning techniques in a practical, easy and fun way. The course provides students with practical hands-on experience in training deep and machine learning models using real-world dataset. This course covers several technique in a practical manner, the projects include but not limited to:\n\n\n(1) Train Deep Learning techniques to perform image classification tasks.\n(2) Develop prediction models to forecast future events such as future commodity prices using state of the art Facebook Prophet Time series.\n(3) Develop Natural Language Processing Models to analyze customer reviews and identify spam\/ham messages.\n(4) Develop recommender systems such as Amazon and Netflix movie recommender systems.\n\n\nThe course is targeted towards students wanting to gain a fundamental understanding of Deep and machine learning models.

This has caused knowledge discovery to garner attention in recent years. However, many real-world datasets are imbalanced.

What could be changed or improved about the way we currently do things to make them easier, cheaper, more efficient or helpful? Next begins the ongoing process of gathering insight. What do people closest to the issue see as the hurdles? How can we collaborate to understand the problem in its most basic form?

I know that it is tough to get a foot in the door without experience, therefore I provide some little known techniques in how to use social media to start your career.\nThere is a lot of hype around data science careers and job opportunities. While some of it is clearly justified, data science is a key technology for the years to come, it is also important to manage your expectations. Salaries are above average, but you need to get the job first. Interviews and assessment centers can be quite tough and the competition is not sleeping.

Candidates with expertise in R programming language are in exceedingly high demand and paid lucratively in Data Science. IEEE has repeatedly ranked R as one of the top and most popular Programming Languages. Almost every Data Science and Machine Learning job posted globally mentions the requirement for R language proficiency. All the top ranked universities like MIT have included R in their respective Data Science courses curriculum. \nWith its growing community of users in Open Source space, R allows you to productively work on complex Data Analysis and Data Science projects to acquire, transform\/cleanse, analyse, model and visualise data to support informed decision making. But there's one catch: R has quite a steep learning curve! \nHow's this course different from so many other courses?\nHow's this course different from so many other courses?\nMany of the available training courses on R programming don't cover it its entirety. To be proficient in R for Data Science requires thorough understanding of R programming constructs, data structures and none of the available courses cover them with the comprehensiveness and depth that each topic deserves. Many courses dive straight into Machine Learning algorithms and advanced stuff without thoroughly comprehending the R programming constructs. Such approaches to teach R have a lot of drawbacks and that's where many Data Scientists struggle with in their professional careers.\nAlso, the real value in learning R lies in learning from professionals who are experienced, proficient and are still working in Industry on huge projects; a trait which is missing in 90% of the training courses available on Udemy and other platforms.\nThis is what makes this course stand-out from the rest. This course has been designed to address these and many other fallacies and uniquely teaches R in a way that you won't find anywhere else. Taught by me, an experienced Data Scientist currently working in Deloitte (World's largest consultancy firm) in Australia and has worked on a number of Data Science projects in multiple niches like Retail, Web, Telecommunication and web-sector. I have over 5 years of diverse experience of working in my own start-ups (related to Data Science and Networking), BPO and digital media consultancy firms, and in academia's Data Science Research Labs. Its a rare combination of exposure that you will hardly find in any other instructor. You will be leveraging my valuable experience to learn and specialize R. \nWhat you're going to learn in this course?\nWhat you're going to learn in this course?\nThe course will start from the very basics of introducing Data Science, importance of R and then will gradually build your concepts. In the first segment, we'll start from setting up R development environment, R Data types, Data Structures (the building blocks of R scripts), Control Structures and Functions. \nThe second segment comprises of applying your learned skills on developing industry-grade Data Science Application. You will be introduced to the mind-set and thought-process of working on Data Science Projects and Application development. The project will then focus on developing automated and robust Web Scraping bot in R. You will get the amazing opportunities to discover what multiple approaches are available and how to assess alternatives while making design decisions (something that Data Scientists do everyday). You will also be exposed to web technologies like HTML, Document Object Model, XPath, RSelenium in the context of web scraping, that will take your data analysis skills to the next level. The course will walk you through the step by step process of scraping real-life and live data from a classifieds website to analyse real-estate trends in Australia. This will involve acquiring, cleansing, munging and analyzing data using R statistical and visualisation capabilities.\nEach and every topic will be thoroughly explained with real-life hands-on examples, exercises along with disseminating implications, nuances, challenges and best-practices based on my years of experience. \n\nWhat you will gain from this course will be incomparable to what's currently available out there as you will be leveraging my growing experience and exposure in Data Science. This course will position you to not only apply for Data Science jobs but will also enable you to use R for more challenging industry-grade projects\/problems and ultimately it will super-charge your career.\nSo take the decision and enrol in this course and lets work together to make you specialize in R Programming like never before!\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone who wants to get started or advance further in Data Science\nAnyone who wants to develop expertise in R programming based on best-practices\nAnyone who wants to learn how to use R for real-life challenging Data Science projects and applications\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone who wants to get started or advance further in Data Science\nAnyone who wants to develop expertise in R programming based on best-practices\nAnyone who wants to learn how to use R for real-life challenging Data Science projects and applications","number_of_lectures":"87 lectures","total_video_duration":"10:59:42","lectures_breakdown":[["Warm Welcome!","Preview\n03:21"],["Why you should learn R?","10:26"],["What you will learn in this course?","07:29"],["Installing R (console) and RStudio (IDE)","07:26"],["Getting to know R -

DAGs combine mathematical graph theory with statistical probability concepts and provide a powerful approach to causal reasoning. Originally developed in the computer science and artificial intelligence field, they nowadays gain more and more traction also in other scientific disciplines (such as, e.g., machine learning, economics, finance, health sciences, and philosophy). DAGs allow to check the validity of causal statements based on intuitive graphical criteria, that do not require any algebra. In addition, they open up the possibility to completely automatize the causal inference task with the help of special identification algorithms. As an encompassing framework for causal thinking, DAGs are becoming an essential tool for everyone interested in data science and machine learning.\nThe course provides a good overview of the theoretical advances that have been made in causal data science during the last thirty year. The focus lies on practical applications of the theory and students will be put into the position to apply causal data science methods in their own work. Hands-on examples, discussed in the statistical software package R, will guide through the presented material. There are no particular prerequisites for participating.

Below are the topics covered in this course.\nLesson 1 :- What is Data science ?\nChapter 1 :- What is Data science  and why do we need it ?\n\nLesson 1 :- What is Data science ?\n\nChapter 2:- Average , Mode , Min and Max using simple Excel.\nChapter 3:- Data science is Multi-disciplinary.\nChapter 4:- Two golden rules for maths for data science.\n\n\nLesson 2 :- What is Data science ?\nLesson 2 :- What is Data science ?\nChapter 4:- Spread and seeing the same visually.\nChapter 5:- Mean,Median,Mode,Max and Min\nChapter 6:- Outlier,Quartile & Inter-Quartile\nChapter 7:- Range and Spread\nLesson 3 - Standard Deviation, Normal Distribution & Emprical Rule.\nChapter 8:- Issues with Range spread calculation\n\nLesson 3 - Standard Deviation, Normal Distribution & Emprical Rule.\n\nChapter 9:- Standard deviation\nChapter 10:- Normal distribution and bell curve understanding\nChapter 11:- Examples of Normal distribution\nChapter 12:- Plotting bell curve using excel\nChapter 13:- 1 , 2 and 3 standard deviation\nChapter 14:- 68,95 and 98 emprical rule.\nChapter 15:- Understanding distribution of 68,95 and 98 in-depth.\n\n\nLesson 4 :- The ZScore calculation\nChapter 16:- Probability of getting 50% above and 50% less.\nLesson 4 :- The ZScore calculation\n\nChapter 17:- Probability of getting 20 value.\nChapter 18:- Probability of getting 40 to 60.\n\n\nLesson 5 - Binomial distribution\nLesson 5 - Binomial distribution\nChapter 22:- Basics of binomial distribution.\nChapter 23:- Calculating existing probability from history.\nChapter 24:- Exact vs Range probability.\nChapter 25:- Applying binomial distribution in excel.\nChapter 26:- Applying Range probability.\nChapter 27:- Rules of Binomial distribution.\nWho this course is for:\nWho want to learn statistic maths from data science perspective.","number_of_lectures":"5 lectures","total_video_duration":"01:09:54","lectures_breakdown":[["Lab 1 :- What is Data science ?","Preview\n09:06"],["Lab 2 - Explain Descriptive Stats, Spread, Outlier and Quartiles in Data Science","Preview\n17:12"],["Lab 3 - Standard Deviation, Normal Distribution & Emprical Rule.","18:31"],["Lab 4 - The ZScore Calculation.","10:57"],["Binomial distrubution","14:08"],["Practice 1 :- Find the odd thing in the dataset","1 question"],["Find spread of the two dataset.","1 question"],["Plot normal distribution.","1 question"]],"original_price":"$19.99","instructor_name":"Shivprasad Koirala","instructor_bio":"My name is Shivprasad Koirala ( thats my young time photo) , I love teaching and learning , I started QuestPond website 15 years back with the one single goal creating quality step by step IT programming related lessons.\nI saw many lessons online , either they are done too fast or too slow or are too complicated.\nThe main goal of Questpond is to create Step by Step lessons on C#, ASP.NET , Design  patterns , SQL and so on.

You do not need software engineering background., Download, install and use the software without expiration date and for free., In less than 2 hours, you will have a very good grasp of the software & you can build your own models","summary":"Assume that you have $ 100,000 and you want to invest this money in 5 stocks.  So you take a piece of paper and you write some mathematical equations.  You say that X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 , X5 are 'variables' that represent the amount of money that you will invest in each of the 5 stocks. So the first inequalities are that:  X1 >=0  ,  X2 >=0  ,  X3 >=0   , X4 >=0  ,  X5 >=0.   Because the amount of money cannot be negative.\nThe second inequality\/equation is that X1  + X2 + X3  +  X4  + X5  =  100,000   , which means that you want to invest all of your money i.e. exactly $ 100,000. This is an equation. So  an optimization problem includes equations and inequalities.\nAlso you have an 'objective'. You want to 'optimize' i.e. maximize, your profit from this investment.  For example, you know that on average, each stock is expected to give you some return over the next year.\nSo if you invest $1 in Stock1 then you expect to end up with $ 1.5 in the end of the year.  For Stocks 2,3,4,5 similarly you expect $2, $3, $4 and - $0.5 So you write:   maximize  1.5*X1 + 2*X2  +3*X3   + 4*X4 -  0.5*X5.  This is your 'objective'. So every 'optimization problem' has an objective : to maximize or minimize something.\nImagine that you have many many more equations and inequalities . For example you want that the average investment to be more than $10,000  i.e. (X1+X2+X3+X4+X5 ) \/5   >=  10,000 . And imagine you have many many many more. So this problem becomes very large ! \nSo the problem becomes hard to solve on paper. When we say 'solve' we mean to find the value of the variables X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, that make us meet our objective. So if we solve all the equations\/inequalities we may end up with a solution that says  X1 = $ 20,000 ,  X2 = $40,000 ,  X3 = $40,000, and X4=0 , X5=0. We call this 'optimal solution'.\nSo when we have really large optimization problems it is better to write these equations into a software such as the one I am teaching in this course. Then we simply press a button and the software after some time (eg 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 10 seconds) depending on how large the problem is, will find for us the optimal solution. There are many 'optimization languages' as we call them. FICO Xpress is one of them , and I find it very easy to learn, and this is why I am teaching it here. You can find other such software including GAMS, and MATLAB. I would recommend to test them all and see which one you prefer. Which one is easier to learn - which is more stable. Have a look for yourself! \nSo in this course we assume that you can translate a problem into equations. So we start from the assumptions that you have the equations \/ inequalities and you dont know how to write them in this software. So I am teaching the software. I also show you how to run the model and how to read the optimal solutions.\nIf you know how to develop optimization models (i.e. to write the code) you will benefit a lot.\nFor example, this skill finds application in finance in terms of identifying the optimal investment portfolio. Platforms such as Nutmeg run 'optimization models' because they try to find the optimal allocation of the stocks and bonds for you to maximize your profit. So if you want to find a job there, you will really benefit a lot if you add this skill on your CV.\nIt finds application in machine learning and in artificial intelligence. Because machine learning is all about making optimal predictions. See the word 'optimal' here. \nIt finds application in business, in terms of identifying the best decision i.e. the one that will maximize profits.\n\n\nSo, by purchasing  this course, you get\n------life-long access to the course and  to the Q & A section. You can also contact me in private for any inquiries, collaborations and business suggestions.\n------life-long access to the course that has more than 1000 students, most of which have experience in optimization and, therefore, you can benefit from exchanging ideas. It is like an optimization forum.\n-----life-long access to updates; this course is a living organism , there will be new videos , new explanations, constant improvements etc.\nFinally you can recommend your own ideas about future courses and subjects to deal with.\n\n\nAnd , last but not least, thank you for your interest in the course.

This is a 4 week course we are\ngoing to teach you some very basic programming aspects in python. And since this is a\ncourse that is geared towards data science towards another course based on what has\nbeen taught in the course, we will also show you two different case studies one is what\nwe call as a function approximation case study another one a classification case study.\nAnd then tell you how to solve those case studies using the programming platform that\nyou have learned. So, in this first introductory lecture I am just going to talk about why\nare we looking at python for data science.\n(Refer Slide Time: 01:10)\n\n\nSo, to look at that first we are going to look at what data science is. This is something\nthat you would have seen in other videos of courses in the NPTEL in other places. Data\nscience is basically the science of analyzing raw data and deriving insights from this\ndata. And you could use multiple techniques to derive insights, you could use simple\nstatistical techniques to derive insights, you could use more complicated and more\nsophisticated machine learning techniques to derive insights and so on.\n\n\nNonetheless the key focus of data science is in actually deriving these insights using\nwhatever techniques that you want to use. Now there is a lot of excitement about data\nscience and this excitement comes because its been shown that you can get very valuable\ninsights, from large data and you can get insights about how different variables change\ntogether, how one variable affects another variable and so on with large data which is not\nvery easy to simply see by very simple computation.\nSo, you need to invest some time and energy, into understanding how you could look at\nthis data and derive these insights from data. And from utilitarian viewpoint, if you look\nat data science in industries if you do proper data science, it allows these industries to\nmake better decisions. These decisions could be in multiple fields for example,\ncompanies could make better purchasing decisions, better hiring decisions, better\ndecisions in terms of how to operate their processes and so on.\nSo, when we talk about decisions, the decisions could be across multiple verticals in an\nindustry. And data science is not only useful from an industrial perspective it is also\nuseful in actual science as themselves. So, where you look at lots of data to model your\nsystem or test your hypotheses or theories about systems and so on. So, when we talk\nabout data science, we start by assuming that we have a large amount of data for the\nproblem of interest. And we are going to basically look at this data we are going to\ninspect the data, we are going to clean and curate the data then we will do some\ntransformation of the data modeling and so on before we can derive insights that are\nvaluable to the organization or to test a theory and so on.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 03:47)\n\n\nNow, coming to a more practical viewpoint of what we do once we have data. I have\nthese four bullet points; which roughly tell you supposing you were solving a data\nscience problem what are the steps you will do? So, you will start with just having data\nsomeone gives you data; and you are trying to derive insights from this data. So, the very\nfirst step is really to bring this data into your system. So, you have to read the data. So,\nthat the data comes into this programming platform so that you can use this data. Now\ndata could be in multiple formats so you could have data in a simple excel sheet or some\nother format.\nSo, we will teach you how to pull data in to your programming platform from multiple\ndata formats. So, that is a first step really if you think about how you are going to solve a\nproblem these steps would be first to simply read the data. And then once you read the\ndata many times you have to do some processing with this data you could have data that\nthat is not correct. For example, we all know that if you have your mobile numbers, there\nare 10 numbers in a mobile number and if there is a column of mobile numbers and then\nsay there is a one row where there are just five numbers then you know there is\nsomething wrong ok. So, this is a very simple check I am talking about in real data\nprocessing this gets much more complicated.\nSo, once you bring the data in when you try to process this data you are going to get\nerrors such as this. So, how do you remove such errors how do you clean the data? Is one\n\n\nactivity that that usually precedes doing you more useful stuff with the data. This is not\nthe only issue that we look at there could be data that is missing.\nSo, for example, there is a variable for which you get a value in multiple situations, but\nin some situations the value is missing. So, what do you do with this data do you throw\nthe record away? Or you do something to fill the data and so on. So, these are all data\nprocessing cleaning steps. So, in this course we will tell you the tools that are available\nin python so that you can do this data processing cleaning and so on.\nNow what you have done at this point is you have been able to get the data into the\nsystem, you have been able to process and clean the data and get to a certain data file or\ndata structure that is reasonably complete so that you think you can work with this data\nset at which point what you will do is you will try to summarize this data. And usually\nsummarization of this data a very simple technique would be very very simple statistical\nmeasures that you will compute; you could for example, computer median, mode, mean\nof a particular column.\nSo, those are simple ideas or summarizing the data you could compute variance and so\non. So, we are going to teach you how to use this notions of statistical quantities that you\ncan use to summarize the data. Once you summarize the data then another activity which\nis usually taken up is what is called visualization right. So, visualization means you look\nat this data and more pictorially to get insights about the data before you bring in heavy\nduty algorithms to bear on this data. And this is a creative aspect of data science, the\nsame data could be visualized by multiple people in multiple ways. And some\nvisualizations are not only I caching, but are also much more informative than other\ntypes of visualization.\nSo, this notion of plotting this data so that some of the attributes are aspects of the data\nare made apparent is this notion of visualization. And there are tools in python that will\nteach you in terms of how you visualize this data. So, at this point you have taken the\ndata, you have cleaned the data, got a set of data points or data structure that you can\nwork with you have done some basic summary of this data that gives you some insights.\nYou also looked at it more visually and you have got some more insights, but when you\nhave large amount of data big data the last step is really deriving those insights which are\nnot readily apparent either through visualization or through simple summary of data.\n\n\nSo, how do we then go and look at more sophisticated analytics or analysis of data so,\nthat these insights come out. And that is where machine learning comes and as a part of\nthis course when you see the progress of this course you will notice that you will go\nthrough all of this, so that you are ready to look at data science problems in a structured\nformat and then use python as a tool to solve some of these problems.\n(Refer Slide Time: 08:57)\n\n\nNow, why python for doing all of this? The number one reason is that there are these\npython libraries, which already are geared towards doing many of the things that we\ntalked about so that it becomes easy for one to program and very quickly you can get\nsome interesting outcomes out of what we are trying to do.\nSo, there are as we talked about in the previous slide, you need to do data manipulation\nand pre processing. There are lots of functions libraries in python where you can do data\nwrangling manipulation and so on. From a data summary viewpoint there are many of\nthese statistical calculations such you want to do are already pre programmed and you\nhave to simply invoke them with your data to be able to show data summary. The next\nstep we talked about visualization there are libraries in python, which can be used to do\nthe visualization.\nAnd finally, for the more sophisticated analysis that we talked about all kinds of machine\nlearning algorithms are already pre coded available as libraries in python. So, again once\nyou understand some bit about these functions and once you get comfortable working in\n\n\npython, then applying certain machine learning algorithms for these problems become\ntrivial. So, you simply call these libraries and then run these algorithms.\n(Refer Slide Time: 10:29)\n\n\nAt a higher level so, in the previous slide we talked about flow process for how I get the\ndata in clean it. And all the way up to insights and then parallelly we said why python\nmakes it easy for us to do all of this. If you go back if you go forward a little more and\nthen, ask in terms of the other advantages of python which are little more than just very\nsimple data science activities. Python provides you several libraries and its being\ncontinuously improved so, anytime there is a new algorithm those are coming into the set\nof libraries. So, in that sense its very varied and there is also a good user community.\nSo, if there are some issues with new libraries and so on and those are fixed so that you\nget robust library to work with and we talk about data and data can be of different scale.\nSo, the examples that you will see in this course are data of reasonably small size, but in\nreal life problems you are going to look at data which is much larger which we call as big\ndata. So, python has an ability to integrate with big data frameworks like hadoop spark\nand so on.\nAnd python also allows you to do more sophisticated programming object oriented\nprogramming and functional programming. Python with all of this sophisticated tools\nand abilities is still reasonably a simple language to learn its reasonably fast to prototype.\nAnd it also gives you the ability to work with data which is in your local machine or in a\n\n\ncloud and so on. So, these are all things that one looks for when one looks at a\nprogramming platform which is capable of solving problems in real life right.\nSo, these are real problems that you can solve, these are not only toy examples, but real\napplications that you can build data science applications that you can build with python.\n(Refer Slide Time: 12:49)\n\n\nAnd just as another pointer in terms of why we believe that python is something that, a\nlot of our students and professionals in India should learn. As you know there are tools\nwhich are paid tools for machine learning with all of these libraries and so on.\nAnd there are also open source tools and in India based on a survey, most people of\ncourse, prefer open source tools for a variety of reasons cause being one because its free\nto use. But also if it is just free to use, but it does not have a robust user community then\nits not really very useful that is where python really scores in terms of a robust user\ncommunity which can help with people working in python. So, it is both open source and\nthere is a robust user community, both of which are advantageous for python.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 13:48).\n\n\nAnd if you think of other competing languages for machine learning; if you look at this\nchart in India about 44 percent of the people who were surveyed said they use python or\nthey prefer python. And of course, a close second is R. In fact, R was much more\npreferred a few years back, but over the last few years in India a python is starting to\nbecome the programming platform of choice. So, in that sense its a good language to\nlearn because the opportunities for jobs and so on or lot more when when you are\ncomfortable with python as a language.\nSo, with this I will stop this brief introduction on why python for data science. I hope I\nhave given you an idea of the fact that while we are going to teach you python as a\nprogramming language, please keep in mind that each module that we teach in this is\nactually geared towards data science. So, as we teach python we will make the\nconnections to how you will use some of the things that you are seeing in data science;\nand all of this we will culminate with these two case studies that will bring all of these\nideas together. In terms of both giving you an idea and an understanding of how the data\nscience problem will be solved and also how it will be solved in python which is a\nprogram of choice currently in India.\nSo, I hope this short four week course, helps you quickly get on to this programming\nplatform. And then learn data science and then, you can enhance your skills with much\n\n\nmore detailed understanding of both the programming language and data science\ntechniques.\nThank you.\n\n\nNow, the commonly used data exploration and visualization tools are Tableau, Qlikview\nand of course, you always have your MS Excel. So, the next bucket that we are going to\nlook into is when you have huge chunks of data, now when your collecting data on a real\ntime basis you are going to be collecting data over every second every minute. Now if\nyou want to store all these data and preprocesses it the regular desktop or computing\nsystems that you have might not be useful.\nSo, that is when you use parallel or distributed computing, where you distribute the work\nacross different systems popular tools that are being used for big data apache spark and\nApache Hadoop. So, in this course we are going to be mainly focusing on tools that are\nrequired for data preprocessing and analysis and in specific we are going to look into\npython.\n(Refer Slide Time: 03:08)\n\n\nSo, let us look at the evolution of python. So, python was developed by Guido van\nRossum in the late eighties at the national research institute for mathematics and\ncomputer science and this institute is located at Netherlands.\n\n\nSo, there are different versions of python, the first version that it was released was in\n1991; the second version was released in 2000 and the third version was released in 2008\nwith version 3.7 being the latest. So, let us look at the advantages of using python.\n(Refer Slide Time: 03:41)\n\n\nSo, python has features that make it well suited for data science. So, let us look at what\nthese features are. So, the first and foremost feature of python is that it is an open source\ntool and python community provides immense support and development to its users. So,\npython was developed under the open source initiative approved license thereby making\nit free to use and distribute even if its for commercial purposes.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 04:05)\n\n\nThe next feature is that the syntax that python use fairly simple to understand and code\nand this breaks all kinds of programming barriers if you are going to switch to a newer\nprogramming language. So, the next important advantage of using python is that, the\nlibraries which are contained in python get installed at the time of installation and these\nlibraries are designed keeping in mind specific data science task and activities.\nPython also integrates well with most of the cloud platform service providers; and this is\na huge advantage if you are looking to use big data. So, if you are going to download\npython from the website and install it, you will see that most of the scripting is done in\nshell. So, there are applications that provide better graphical user interfaced for the end\nusers and these are taken care by the integrated development environment.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 04:57)\n\n\nSo, now, let us see what an integrated development environment is, an IDE as how its\nabbreviated is a software application and it consists of tools which are required for\ndevelopment. All these tools are consolidated and brought together under one roof inside\nthe application. IDEs are also designed to simplify the software development this is very\nuseful because as an end user, if you are not a developer you might want all the tools\navailable at a single click. Using an IDE will be very beneficial in that case also the\nfeatures provided by IDEs include tools for managing compiling deploying and\ndebugging a software. So, these also form the code features of any IDEs.\n(Refer Slide Time: 05:44)\n\n\nSo, now let us look at what are the features of an IDE in depth. So, any IDE should\nconsist of three important features; the first is the source code or text editor, the second is\na compiler and the third is a debugger. Now all these three features form the crux of any\nsoftware development.\nThe IDEs can also have additional features like syntax and error highlighting code\ncompletion and version control.\n(Refer Slide Time: 06:09)\n\n\nSo, let us see what are the commonly used IDEs for python, the most frequently used as\nSpider, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook and Atom. And these are basically from the\nendpoint of the user, depending on what he or she is comfortable with.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 06:24)\n\n\nSo, now let us look at spider, the spider is an IDE and it supported across Linux, Macs\nand Windows platforms. It is also an open source software and it is bundled up with\nAnaconda distribution which comes up with all inbuilt python libraries.\nSo, if you want to work with spider you do not have to install any of the libraries. So, all\nthe necessary libraries are taken care by Anaconda. So, another important feature of\nspider is that it was specifically developed for data science and it was developed in\npython and for python.\n(Refer Slide Time: 06:57)\n\n\nSo, this is how the interface of spider looks, you have the scripting window and you have\nother console output here, you have a variable explorer here. All these features we are\ngoing to be looking at in the next few lectures to come.\n(Refer Slide Time: 07:11)\n\n\nThe other features of spider includes a code editor, with robust syntax error highlighting\nfeatures; it also helps in code completion and navigation it consist of a debugger, it also\nconsist of an integrated documents that can be viewed within the python interface on the\nweb. Another advantage of using spider is that it has a interface which is very similar to\nMATLAB and RStudio\u2019s. So, if you are a person who is already work with these two\nprogramming languages and are looking to switch to python, then the transition is also\ngoing to be seamless.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 07:44)\n\n\nSo, now let us look at the second IDE which is pyCharm. So, pyCharm is also supported\nacross all OS X systems which is Linux Macs and windows. It has two versions to it one\nis the community version which is an open source software; the other is the professional\nversion which is a paid software. So, pyCharm supports only python and it is bundled up\nand packaged with Anaconda distribution which comes with all the inbuilt python\nlibraries. But; however, if you want to install pyCharm separately then that can also be\ndone.\n(Refer Slide Time: 08:14)\n\n\nSo, this is how the interface of pyCharm looks, you have a very very well define\nstructure for naming your directories and you have the scripting window here.\n(Refer Slide Time: 08:25)\n\n\nSo, let us look at some of the features that pyCharm consists of. The first is that it\nconsists of a code editor which provides syntax and error highlighting; then it consists of\na code completion and navigation feature it also consists of a unit testing tool which will\nhelp the compiler go through each and every line of the code. It also consists of a\ndebugger and controls the versions.\n(Refer Slide Time: 08:48)\n\n\nSo, now let us look at the next IDE which is Jupyter notebook. So, now, Jupyter\nnotebook is very different from the earlier two IDEs in the sense that it is a web\napplication which allows creation and manipulation of the codes; now these codes are\ncalled notebook documents and hence that is how Jupyter gets its name Jupyter note\nbook. Now Jupyter is supported across all operating systems and it is available as an\nopen source version.\n(Refer Slide Time: 09:18)\n\n\nNow, this is the interface of Jupyter, you can see that you have few cells here as an input\nyou also have some output let me just zoom in and show you how the interface looks.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 09:33)\n\n\nSo, here you can see some of the codes that is written, if you just scroll up and see this is\nsome narrative about whatever you have written.\n(Refer Slide Time: 09:41)\n\n\nSo, Jupyter is bundled with Anaconda distribution, but it can also be install separately. It\nprimarily supports Julia, python, R and Scala. So, if you look at the name Jupyter it\nbasically takes the first two letters from Julia the next two from python and then R.\n\n\nSo, that is how Jupyter gets its name as Jupyter it also consists of an ordered collection\nof input and output cells like how we earlier saw; and these can contain narrative text,\ncode, plots and any kind of media.\n(Refer Slide Time: 10:13)\n\n\nOne of the key features of Jupyter notebook is that, it allows sharing of code and\nnarrative text through output formats like HTML markdown or PDF. If you are working\nin an education environment or if you would like to have a better presentation tool, then\nyou can use these kind of output formats to present. So, though Jupyter consist of\nfeatures that give a very good aesthetic appeal to it, it is deficit of the important features\nof a good IDE. So, by good IDE I mean it should consist of a source code editor and\ncompiler and a debugger; and all three of these are not provided by Jupyter.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 10:50)\n\n\nSo, the next IDE that we are going to look into is atom. So, atom is an open source text\nand source code editor and it supported again across all over systems; it again supports\nprogramming languages like python PHP Java etcetera. And it is very very well suited\nfor developers, it also helps the users to install plug ins or packages. So, one common\ndrawback with all these text editors and source code editor is that these do not come\ninstalled with basic libraries of any programming languages; you have to install these\nkind of packages as and when you have a need for them.\nSo, that is one major drawback for using any kind of text editor or the source code editor.\nBut; however, atom does provide packages or libraries that are suited for data science\nand code completion or code navigation or debugging. So, you can install it, so if you are\na developer and if you want to code an text editor environment then you can go ahead\nwith atom. But you will have to install all these packages as and when you require.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 11:52)\n\n\nSo, this is the interface of atom, this is how it looks it, it is a proper text editor interface.\n(Refer Slide Time: 12:00)\n\n\nSo, how will you choose the best IDEs then important question. So, it basically depends\non your requirements, but it is a good habit to work first with different IDEs to\nunderstand what your own requirements are. So, if you are new to python then it is better\nthat you work across all these IDEs and there are several other IDEs out there you can\nwork with all these IDEs see what suits you and then take a call on which IDE to use.\n\n\nBut in this course we are going to be looking at spider; and that is primarily because it is\na very good software that has been developed only for data science and python; and it as\nan interface that is very very appealing and easy to use for beginners.\n(Refer Slide Time: 12:43)\n\n\nSo, to summarize in this lecturer we saw what are the popular tools used in data science\nenvironment. We also saw how python evolved and what are the commonly used\nintegrated development environment. We also looked at what each of these IDE have to\noffer us and some of the common pros and cons of each of these.\n\n\nWelcome to the lecture on Introduction to Spyder, in this lecture we are going to see how\ndoes the interface of spyder look? How to set the working directory and how to create\nand save a Python file?\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 00:28)\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 00:32)\n\n\nSo, let us see how does the appearance of spyder look. So, on my left you can see a\nsnapshot of the screen that would appear once you open Spyder. So, the Python version\nthat I am using to illustrate this lecture is version 3.6. So, once you open you will get a\nsmall description of the author name and when the file was created. There are a couple of\nwindows though here so let us see what each of these windows mean.\nSo, the entire interface is split into three windows, the window on my left is called the\nscripting window and all your lines of codes and commands that you are going to type\n\n\nwill be displayed here. So, you have to write all your commands and codes here on my\nright I have two windows, the top section is where you would find tabs that read as file\nexplorer, help and variable explorer.\nNow under file explorer once you set the directory if you have any files that are existing\nin your current working directory, then all these files will be displayed under file\nexplorer under variable explorer you will basically be having a display of all the objects\nand variables that you have used in your code. Now, along with the variables you also\nhave their name, type and size. Now, name is the name of the variable, type is the data\ntype and size is whether it is an array or a single value. Now, the first few values will be\ndisplayed if it is only a single value then the single value be displayed under, the heading\nvalue the section on the bottom is the console.\nSo, console so is an output window where you will be seeing all your printed statements\nand outputs, you can also perform elementary operations in your console, but the only\ndisadvantage is that you will not be able to save it. Now however, whatever you type in\nthe scripting window can always be saved. So, we are going to look into how to save the\nlines of commands that you have used in your scripting window and we will do that once\nthe lecture proceeds.\n(Refer Slide Time: 02:34)\n\n\nNow, let us see how to set the working directory, there are three ways to set a working\ndirectory the first is using an icon, the second is using the inbuilt library OS and the third\nis using a command CD which means change directory.\n(Refer Slide Time: 02:47)\n\n\nNow, let us see how to set a working directory using the icon. If you look at the top\nsection here you will see an icon here with a folder open, now you can choose a working\ndirectory by clicking on this icon. Once you choose you will be prompted to choose a\nlocation or a folder. Now, you can choose a suitable folder or a suitable location by\nclicking on the icon and once you click on the location your directory is considered to be\nset. Now this is an easy method and if you do not want to be typing commands every\nsingle time, then you can just do a drag and drop.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 03:28)\n\n\nNow, let us look at the second and the third methods, now you need to import a library\ncalled OS, OS stands for Operating Systems. Before you use a function from this library\nto change the directory you need to import it. So, import is a function that you will use to\nload a library to your environment.\nNow, once you load the library OS on your environment you can use the function chdir\nwhich means change directory. So, I need to use the name of the library which is OS in\nthis case followed by a dot and then use chdir. Now, within parenthesis you we can give\nsingle or double quotes. So, copy the entire path from your directory and then paste it\nhere or you can also type it out. The third method is using the command CD, CD also\nmeans Change Directory and you can give a space after the command and then give the\npath. So, this how you set a working directory.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 04:32)\n\n\nNow, once you set the working directory if you have any folders or any subfolders or any\nother files inside the working directory, all of that will be displayed under file explorer.\nFor me I have a couple of files under this directory and hence it is being displayed here\nfor me. But of course, if you are opening a new folder you are likely to see this space as\nempty now you can check all your files and sub file and sub directories here under file\nexplorer.\n(Refer Slide Time: 05:09)\n\n\nSo, we have seen how to set a working directory, now let us see how to create a file. So,\nthere are two ways to go about it the first is by clicking an icon that looks like a page\nfolded on the right. Now, this you can find on the toolbar. So, on the icon bar towards\nyour extreme left you will see a page that is folded on the right, now if you click on that\na new script file will open. I have also shown you a zoomed in version of the icon, so this\nis how it looks, the moment you click on it a new script file will pop up.\n(Refer Slide Time: 05:39)\n\n\nNow, the second method is by clicking on the file menu and then selecting new file. So,\nyou can see the file menu here and then from that click on new file. Now, apart from\nthese two methods you always have a fallback option of using the keyboard shortcut\nwhich is control plus N, in all these three methods right away open a script file for you\ntill. Now, we have set the working directory we have created a script file. So, now let us\ntype few pieces of code before we save our script file, but even before we go there let us\nlook at what a variable means.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 06:00)\n\n\nSo, variable is an identifier that contains a known information, the known information\nthat is contained within an identifier referred to as a value. So, a variable name will\nactually point to a memory address or a storage location and then this location is actually\nused to cross refer to the stored value. So, variable name can be descriptive or can also\nconsist of single alphabets. So, we will look into the naming conventions of naming a\nvariable in the lectures to come.\n(Refer Slide Time: 06:47)\n\n\nSo, let us go ahead and create few variables, now you will see a snapshot of a code here\non my left I have zoomed in the lines of code on my right. So, let me again zoom in and\nshow you now I am assigning a value of 11 to a. So, in Python the assignment operator\nthat you will be using to assign a value is equal to. So, I am storing a value of 11 in a, a is\nmy variable name and I am saying b is equal to 8 times 10.\nSo, this is a multiplication and the multiplication operator in Python is referred as\nasterisk. So, once I create both my variables I would like to print the values of a and b,\nnow because I want to print two values together; I am going to separate them with a\ncomma inside the print statement. So, the print statement will help me print the output\nand since I want to print two outputs here I am going to separate them with a comma.\nHowever, if you just want to print one statement you can just give a single object inside\nthe parentheses.\n(Refer Slide Time: 07:59)\n\n\nSo, now let us go ahead and save our script files. So, to save your script file you can\nclick on the file menu again and you can see there are three different options here. So, let\nus see what these options are I am going to zoom in a bit to show you the list of options\nthat you have. So, the first option is save which is represented as control plus S in your\nkeyboard shortcut. Now, if you already have a file now if you are making some changes\nto it, then if you would like to save changes that you made then you can just simply click\non save.\n\n\nNow if you are making changes across multiple files. So, now, if you are opening\nmultiple files and making changes in all of them then you can use the option save all. So,\nwhat save all does is that it will save all the changes made across all the files that are\nopen. So, this is the use of save all. So, the third option is what is called as save as, now\nif you are creating a new file and you would like to rename it and save it then you would\nbe using save as. So, let us see how to save a new script file for the very first time.\n(Refer Slide Time: 09:07)\n\n\nSo, once you click on save as it will prompt you to give a name for the file. Now, you\ncan choose your directory here as to where you want to just save it or if you already in\nyour working directory then you can just go there and save it. So, dot py is the extension\nthat is used to save a Python script file. Now once you do this you can just click on save\nand your file is saved.\n\n\n(Refer Slide Time: 09:35)\n\n\nSo, to summarize in this lecture we saw how the interface of Spyder looks, we saw how\nto set the working directory and how to create and save Python script files.\nWho this course is for:\nBeginner python developers curious for data science","number_of_lectures":"182 lectures","total_video_duration":"58:28:11","lectures_breakdown":[["Introduction","Preview\n16:00"],["spyder","Preview\n10:08"],["spyder part 2","Preview\n14:59"],["variables and data types","Preview\n12:24"],["operators","21:26"],["Lists part","Preview\n07:07"],["Lists part 2","12:52"],["tuples","14:02"],["dictionary","33:42"],["sets","35:30"],["numpy part","20:02"],["numpy part","19:18"],["matrix","20:43"],["linear algebra","12:02"],["linear","06:02"],["Reading Data","20:26"],["Pandas data frames","22:26"],["Pandas data frames","Preview\n24:13"],["pandas part 3","18:16"],["control structure","28:22"],["exploratory","29:34"],["data visual","18:02"],["data","34:50"],["dealing with missing data","32:19"],["Linear regression","41:02"],["Model Assesment","35:41"],["diagnostics","29:09"],["lecture 1","26:26"],["lecture 2","34:47"],["lecture 3","26:36"],["lecture 4","17:55"],["lecture 5","22:49"],["lecture 6","25:09"],["lecture 7","29:41"],["lecture 8","05:25"],["lecture 9","26:57"],["lecture 10","36:12"],["lecture 11","28:02"],["lecture 12","37:45"],["lecture 13","31:09"],["lecture 14","40:08"],["lecture 15","32:19"],["lecture 16","29:04"],["lecture 16\/b","29:42"],["lecture 17","35:14"],["lecture 18","32:54"],["lecture 19","32:49"],["lecture 20","31:26"],["lecture 21","25:32"],["lecture 22","16:00"],["lecture 23","35:50"],["lecture 24","07:24"],["lecture 25","21:27"],["lecture 26","18:49"],["lecture 27","18:20"],["lecture 28","17:24"],["lecture 1","13:52"],["lecture 2","24:56"],["lecture 3","27:28"],["lecture 4","23:54"],["lecture 5","10:53"],["lecture 6","23:32"],["lecture 7","12:25"],["lecture 8","18:45"],["lecture 9","12:28"],["lecture 10","21:22"],["Classification","19:19"],["K -

Periodically, all the systems would backup and combine the data into a database where reports could be run and everyone could get insight into what was going on.\nThe problem was that the database technology simply couldn\u2019t handle multiple, continuous streams of data. It couldn\u2019t handle the volume of data. It couldn\u2019t modify the incoming data in real-time. And reporting tools were lacking that couldn\u2019t handle anything but a relational query on the back-end. Big Data solutions offer cloud hosting, highly indexed and optimized data structures, automatic archival and extraction capabilities, and reporting interfaces have been designed to provide more accurate analyses that enable businesses to make better decisions.\nBetter business decisions means that companies can reduce the risk of their decisions, and make better decisions that reduce costs and increase marketing and sales effectiveness.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Big Data?\nThis infographic from Informatica walks through the risks and opportunities associated with leveraging big data in corporations.\nBig Data is Timely \u2013 A large percentage of each workday, knowledge workers spend attempting to find and manage data.\nBig Data is Timely\n\nBig Data is Accessible \u2013 Senior executives report that accessing the right data is difficult.\nBig Data is Accessible\n\nBig Data is Holistic \u2013 Information is currently kept in silos within the organization.

Things as simple as monitoring multiple systems for customer contact information updates can save millions of dollars.\nBig Data is Trustworthy\nBig Data is Relevant \u2013 Organizations are dissatisfied with their tools ability to filter out irrelevant data. Something as simple as filtering customers from your web analytics can provide a ton of insight into your acquisition efforts.\nBig Data is Relevant\nBig Data is Authoritive \u2013 Organizations struggle with multiple versions of the truth depending on the source of their data.

In this course, I cover what it is like to be a data analyst, what are some jobs of data analysts, what are the sorts of super powers you can possess by learning Hadoop, and also what resources you will need on your path to development as a Big Data. My hope is to transform you in 4-5 lectures from being a novice to data and what is possible with Hadoop to being someone who has a clear idea of whether he\/she is interested in Hadoop and what path they can take to further their knowledge and harness the POWER of Hadooop.\n\nThere is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of Hadoop I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how you can start learning how to dominate data analytics and how you can supercharge your business, marketing, or client with your superb analytics skills.\nWho this course is for:\nThis course is meant for students willing to next generation Information Technology\nAnybody who wants an entry to the realm of Big Data\nNo prior Big Data experience is needed\nWho this course is for:\nThis course is meant for students willing to next generation Information Technology\nAnybody who wants an entry to the realm of Big Data\nNo prior Big Data experience is needed","number_of_lectures":"7 lectures","total_video_duration":"46:07","lectures_breakdown":[["Introduction - What is Big Data","Preview\n12:39"],["HDFS","05:54"],["MapReduce","06:35"],["Hadoop Ecosystem","05:03"],["Next Steps","07:24"],["Resources","06:36"],["Conclusion","01:56"]],"original_price":"$19.99","instructor_name":"Dhruv Bais","instructor_bio":"Hi!

Where is this data coming from, how is it being processed, and how are the results being used?\n\nWhat is big data?\nWhat is big data?\nBig data can be characterised as data that has high volume,high variety and high velocity. Data includes numbers, text, images, audio, video, or any other kind of information you might store on your computer. Volume, velocity, and variety are sometimes called \"the 3 V's of big data.\"\nWhat kind of datasets are considered big data?\nWhat kind of datasets are considered big data?\nExamples includes social media network analyzing their members' data to learn more about them and connect them with content and advertising relevant to their interests, or search engines looking at the relationship between queries and results to give better answers to users' questions.\nHow is big data analyzed?\nHow is big data analyzed?\nOne of the best known methods for turning raw data into useful information is by what is known as MapReduce. MapReduce is a method for taking a large data set and performing computations on it across multiple computers, in parallel. It serves as a model for how program, and is often used to refer to the actual implementation of this model.\nMapReduce consists of two parts. The Map function does sorting and filtering, taking data and placing it inside of categories so that it can be analysed. The Reduce function provides a summary of this data by combining it all together.\nWhat You Will Learn\nWhat You Will Learn\n        What is big data\n        What is high volume\n        What is high variety\n        What is high variety\n       Google\u2019s Big Data Approach\n       What is  Cluster\n       What is a Node\n       What is GFS\n       What is Big Table\n       What is MapReduce\n       What is Hadoop\n        What is big data\n        What is high volume\n        What is high variety\n        What is high variety\n       Google\u2019s Big Data Approach\n       What is  Cluster\n       What is a Node\n       What is GFS\n       What is Big Table\n       What is MapReduce\n       What is Hadoop\nWho this course is for:\nData Analyst\nSQL Aspiring developers\nSQL Developers\nDatabase Administrator\nDatabase Developers\nIT Professionals\nAspiring Data Analyst\nAspiring Data Warehouse Professionals\nWho this course is for:\nData Analyst\nSQL Aspiring developers\nSQL Developers\nDatabase Administrator\nDatabase Developers\nIT Professionals\nAspiring Data Analyst\nAspiring Data Warehouse Professionals\nData Analyst\nSQL Aspiring developers\nSQL Developers\nDatabase Administrator\nDatabase Developers","number_of_lectures":"12 lectures","total_video_duration":"31:57","lectures_breakdown":[["Introduction","Preview\n02:33"],["What is Big Data","Preview\n02:43"],["What is High Volume","Preview\n03:03"],["What is High Variety","Preview\n03:22"],["What is High Velocity","03:10"],["Introduction to the Google Approach","00:33"],["What is a cluster","00:56"],["What is a Node","01:29"],["The Google File System -GFS","01:38"],["Google's Big Table","03:35"],["What is MapReduce","06:14"],["Introduction To Apache Hadoop","02:41"]],"original_price":"$64.99","instructor_name":"Bluelime Learning Solutions","instructor_bio":"Bluelime is UK based and creates quality easy to understand  eLearning  solutions .All our courses are 100% video based.

The value of data isn\u2019t understood until we start finding patterns and trends within the data, which we can then start using for making more sound and informed decisions.\nHowever, there are technological solutions to help you not only sort data, but also help you find these trends within them.

And, this is exactly what we are offering in this Big Data for absolute beginners course!\nBig Data for absolute beginners course!\nHadoop is an open-source framework and is the more popular solution to big data. It works for storing and processing big data sets using the MapReduce programming model, in which it split files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster. These clustered packaged codes are then transferred to nodes to process the data in parallel. This simplifies the process of sorting and processes data faster and more efficiently.\nAnd in this course, you will learn not only about Hadoop and associated technologies but also everything you need to know about Big Data. From installation to configuration and even to actually tackling big data, you will become a big master expert with our course.\n\nDesigned from the ground up, the only pre-requisite is knowing UNIX and Java. In collaboration with Big Data experts, at the end of this course you will not only have the theoretical knowledge, but also the confidence for putting this knowledge into practical application.

Many believe that it's the data scientist but several studies have broken down the job descriptions and the most needed position is that of the data engineer. \n2) Google's the World Leader in Data\n2)\nGoogle's the World Leader in Data\nAmazon's AWS is the most used cloud and Azure has the best UI but no cloud vendor in the world understands data like Google. They are the world leader in open sources artificial intelligence. You can't be the leader in AI without being the leader in data. \n3) 90% of all Organizational Data is Unstructured\n3)\n90% of all Organizational Data is Unstructured\nThe study of big data is the study of unstructured data. As the data in companies grows most will need to scale to unprecedented level. Without a significant investment in infrastructure and talent this won't be possible without the cloud. \n4) The Data Revolution is Now\n4)\nThe Data Revolution is Now\nWe are in a data revolution. Data used to be viewed as a simple necessity and lower on the totem pole. Now it is more widely recognized as the source of truth. As we move into more complex systems of data management, the role of the data engineer becomes extremely important as a bridge between the DBA and the data consumer. Beyond the ubiquitous spreadsheet, graduating from RDBMS (which will always have a place in the data stack), we now work with NoSQL and Big Data technologies.\n\n5) Data is Foundation \n5) Data is Foundation \nData engineers are the plumbers building a data pipeline, while data scientists are the painters and storytellers giving meaning to an otherwise static entity. Simply put, data engineers clean, prepare and optimize data for consumption. Once the data becomes useful, data scientists can perform a variety of analyses and visualization techniques to truly understand the data, and eventually, tell a story from the data. \n\nThank you for your interest in Managing Big Data on Google's Cloud Platform and we will see you in the course!!\nManaging Big Data on Google's Cloud Platform\nWho this course is for:\nData engineers preparing for the Google Certified Data Engineering Exam.\nMachine learning engineers learning how to build models at scale on GCP.\nDatabase professionals and developers moving to the Google Cloud Platform.\nWho this course is for:\nData engineers preparing for the Google Certified Data Engineering Exam.\nMachine learning engineers learning how to build models at scale on GCP.\nDatabase professionals and developers moving to the Google Cloud Platform.","number_of_lectures":"41 lectures","total_video_duration":"01:28:24","lectures_breakdown":[["Introduction","Preview\n01:39"],["Is this Course for You?","Preview\n01:31"],["Instructor Course Q&A","Preview\n02:17"],["Unstructured Data","Preview\n02:47"],["Data Sources","Preview\n02:16"],["Summary","00:50"],["Quiz","5 questions"],["Why Use GCP for Big Data?","01:41"],["On-Premise Hadoop Build","01:38"],["Scaling up or Scaling Out","01:31"],["Zones and Regions","02:10"],["Separating Compute and Storage","01:52"],["Cloud Dataproc Architecture","01:30"],["Summary","01:11"],["Quiz","10 questions"],["Create Cluster Screen","01:51"],["Create Dataproc Cluster in GCP Console","03:57"],["Create a Cluster using the Shell","03:15"],["The Three Dataproc Configurations","02:34"],["Using Preemption on Cloud Dataproc","05:13"],["How GCP Handles Preemption","01:06"],["Image Version Options","02:21"],["Scaling Clusters","02:52"],["Creating a Custom Image","02:00"],["Cluster Customization","02:18"],["3 Steps to Install Additional Software on Clusters","01:08"],["Initialization Actions","05:10"],["High Availability","01:26"],["Summary","01:08"],["Quiz","15 questions"],["The Submit Jobs Screen","02:13"],["Submitting Spark Job - Console","06:40"],["Submitting Spark Job - Google Cloud Shell","03:18"],["Submitting PySpark Job - SSH","02:02"],["Moving from On-Premise to Google Cloud Dataproc","01:31"],["Python and Scala Code Reference Change","01:06"],["Summary","00:53"],["Quiz","10 questions"],["White Boarding: Difference between On-prem and Cloud Dataproc","02:39"],["White Boarding: Moving Jobs to GCP","01:08"],["White Boarding: Data Near Clusters","01:24"],["White Boarding: Defining Preemptibles","01:30"],["White Boarding: On-Premise Architecture to GCP","02:17"],["White Boarding: Add Software to Nodes","01:33"],["Summary","00:55"]],"original_price":"$49.99","instructor_name":"Mike West","instructor_bio":"I've worked with databases for over two decades.

But when you ask yourself, what is my position with respect to this new industrial revolution, that might lead you to another fundamental question: am I a consumer or a creator? For most people nowadays, the answer would be, a consumer.\nBut what if you could also become a creator?\nWhat if there was a way for you to easily break into the World of Artificial Intelligence and build amazing applications which leverage the latest technology to make the World a better place?\nSounds too good to be true, doesn't it?\nBut there actually is a way..\nComputer Vision is by far the easiest way of becoming a creator.\nAnd it's not only the easiest way, it's also the branch of AI where there is the most to create.\nWhy? You'll ask.\nThat's because Computer Vision is applied everywhere. From health to retail to entertainment - the list goes on. Computer Vision is already a $18 Billion market and is growing exponentially.\nJust think of tumor detection in patient MRI brain scans. How many more lives are saved every day simply because a computer can analyze 10,000x more images than a human?\nAnd what if you find an industry where Computer Vision is not yet applied? Then all the better! That means there's a business opportunity which you can take advantage of.\nSo now that raises the question: how do you break into the World of Computer Vision?\nUp until now, computer vision has for the most part been a maze. A growing maze.\nAs the number of codes, libraries and tools in CV grows, it becomes harder and harder to not get lost.\nOn top of that, not only do you need to know how to use it - you also need to know how it works to maximise the advantage of using Computer Vision.\nTo this problem we want to bring... \nComputer Vision A-Z.\nWith this brand new course you will not only learn how the most popular computer vision methods work, but you will also learn to apply them in practice!\nCan't wait to see you inside the class,\nKirill & Hadelin\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone interested in Computer Vision or Artificial Intelligence","number_of_lectures":"84 lectures","total_video_duration":"11:04:03","lectures_breakdown":[["Welcome to the Course!","Preview\n01:10"],["BONUS: Learning Paths","00:51"],["Some Additional Resources!!","00:14"],["This PDF resource will help you a lot!","00:32"],["FAQBot!","01:29"],["Get the materials","00:06"],["Plan of attack","01:27"],["Updates on Udemy Reviews","01:09"],["Viola-Jones Algorithm","Preview\n09:35"],["Haar-like Features","14:42"],["Integral Image","10:23"],["Training Classifiers","10:49"],["Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost)","16:26"],["Cascading","06:13"],["Face Detection Intuition","5 questions"],["Welcome to the Practical Applications","05:12"],["Installations Instructions (once and for all!)","14:40"],["Common Debug Tips","00:13"],["Face Detection - Step 1","06:49"],["Face Detection - Step 2","05:28"],["Face Detection - Step 3","03:53"],["Face Detection - Step 4","05:13"],["Face Detection - Step 5","04:53"],["Face Detection - Step 6","11:16"],["Face Detection with OpenCV","5 questions"],["Homework Challenge - Instructions","00:39"],["Homework Challenge - Solution (Video)","19:07"],["Homework Challenge - Solution (Code files)","00:04"],["Plan of attack","Preview\n02:08"],["How SSD is different","09:14"],["The Multi-Box Concept","10:18"],["Predicting Object Positions","09:52"],["The Scale Problem","Preview\n12:42"],["Object Detection Intuition","5 questions"],["Object Detection - Step 1","09:11"],["Object Detection - Step 2","05:11"],["Object Detection - Step 3","07:24"],["Object Detection - Step 4","08:59"],["Object Detection - Step 5","05:12"],["Object Detection - Step 6","17:49"],["Object Detection - Step 7","05:40"],["Object Detection - Step 8","03:49"],["Object Detection - Step 9","14:08"],["Object Detection - Step 10","16:43"],["Training the SSD","00:16"],["Object Detection with SSD","5 questions"],["Homework Challenge - Instructions","00:15"],["Homework Challenge - Solution (Video)","15:01"],["Homework Challenge - Solution (Code files)","00:04"],["Plan of Attack","02:55"],["The Idea Behind GANs","06:57"],["How Do GANs Work?

The model is so strong that for the first time in our courses, we are able to solve the most challenging virtual AI applications (training an ant\/spider and a half humanoid to walk and run across a field).\nTo approach this model the right way, we structured the course in three parts:\nPart 1: Fundamentals\nIn this part we will study all the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence which will allow you to understand and master the AI of this course. These include Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic and more.\nPart 2: The Twin-Delayed DDPG Theory\nWe will study in depth the whole theory behind the model. You will clearly see the whole construction and training process of the AI through a series of clear visualization slides. Not only will you learn the theory in details, but also you will shape up a strong intuition of how the AI learns and works. The fundamentals in Part 1, combined to the very detailed theory of Part 2, will make this highly advanced model accessible to you, and you will eventually be one of the very few people who can master this model.\nPart 3: The Twin-Delayed DDPG Implementation\nWe will implement the model from scratch, step by step, and through interactive sessions, a new feature of this course which will have you practice on many coding exercises while we implement the model. By doing them you will not follow passively the course but very actively, therefore allowing you to effectively improve your skills. And last but not least, we will do the whole implementation on Colaboratory, or Google Colab, which is a totally free and open source AI platform allowing you to code and train some AIs without having any packages to install on your machine. In other words, you can be 100% confident that you press the execute button, the AI will start to train and you will get the videos of the spider and humanoid running in the end.\nPart 1: Fundamentals\nIn this part we will study all the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence which will allow you to understand and master the AI of this course.

Unsupervised deep learning!\ndeep learning, data science,\nmachine learning\nunsupervised learning\nclustering\ndensity estimation\nIn these course we\u2019ll start with some very basic stuff - principal components analysis (PCA), and a popular nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique known as t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding).\nprincipal components analysis (PCA)\nt-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding)\nNext, we\u2019ll look at a special type of unsupervised neural network called the autoencoder. After describing how an autoencoder works, I\u2019ll show you how you can link a bunch of them together to form a deep stack of autoencoders, that leads to better performance of a supervised deep neural network. Autoencoders are like a non-linear form of PCA.\nautoencoder\ndeep neural network\nLast, we\u2019ll look at restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). These are yet another popular unsupervised neural network, that you can use in the same way as autoencoders to pretrain your supervised deep neural network. I\u2019ll show you an interesting way of training restricted Boltzmann machines, known as Gibbs sampling, a special case of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and I\u2019ll demonstrate how even though this method is only a rough approximation, it still ends up reducing other cost functions, such as the one used for autoencoders. This method is also known as Contrastive Divergence or CD-k. As in physical systems, we define a concept called free energy and attempt to minimize this quantity.\nrestricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)\npretrain\nGibbs sampling\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo,\nContrastive Divergence\nCD-k\nfree energy\nFinally, we\u2019ll bring all these concepts together and I\u2019ll show you visually what happens when you use PCA and t-SNE on the features that the autoencoders and RBMs have learned, and we\u2019ll see that even without labels the results suggest that a pattern has been found.\nAll the materials used in this course are FREE. Since this course is the 4th in the deep learning series, I will assume you already know calculus, linear algebra, and Python coding. You'll want to install Numpy, Theano, and Tensorflow for this course. These are essential items in your data analytics toolbox.\nPython\nNumpy,\nTheano, and Tensorflow\ndata analytics\nIf you are interested in deep learning and you want to learn about modern deep learning developments beyond just plain backpropagation, including using unsupervised neural networks to interpret what features can be automatically and hierarchically learned in a deep learning system, this course is for you.\nbackpropagation\nThis course focuses on \"how to build and understand\", not just \"how to use\". Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about \"remembering facts\", it's about \"seeing for yourself\" via experimentation. It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally.

This article covers the case of a binary dependent variable\u2014that is, where the output can take only two values, \"0\" and \"1\", which represent outcomes such as pass\/fail, win\/lose, alive\/dead or healthy\/sick. Cases where the dependent variable has more than two outcome categories may be analysed in multinomial logistic regression, or, if the multiple categories are ordered, in ordinal logistic regression. In the terminology of economics, logistic regression is an example of a qualitative response\/discrete choice model.\nLogistic Regression\nLogistic Regression was developed by statistician David Cox in 1958. The binary logistic model is used to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor (or independent) variables (features). It allows one to say that the presence of a risk factor increases the odds of a given outcome by a specific factor.\nLogistic Regression\n\n\nPolynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in X. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of X and the corresponding conditional mean of Y. denoted E(y |x), and has been used to describe nonlinear phenomena such as the growth rate of tissues, the distribution of carbon isotopes in lake sediments, and the progression of disease epidemics. Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, Polynomial Regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.\nPolynomial Regression\nX\nX\nPolynomial Regression\nThe predictors resulting from the polynomial expansion of the \"baseline\" predictors are known as interaction features. Such predictors\/features are also used in classification settings.\nIn this Course you learn Polynomial Regression & Logistic Regression You learn how to estimate  output of nonlinear system by Polynomial Regressions to find the possible future output Next you go further  You will learn how to classify output of model by using Logistic Regression\nPolynomial Regression & Logistic Regression \nPolynomial Regressions\nLogistic Regression\nIn the first section you learn how to use python to estimate output of your system.

It can be used across a wide range of game genres from first-person shooters to real-time strategies, to develop intelligent characters capable of making smart decisions without the need for large finite state machines.   The codebase is deceptively simple and yet logical, reusable and extremely powerful.  The library is written in C# and implemented in Unity V.2019, however will easily port to other applications.\nGoal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)\nC#\nUnity V.2019\n\nIn this course, Penny demystifies the advanced AI technique of GOAP used for creating believable and intelligent game characters in games using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and knowledge from over 25 years working with games, graphics and having written two award-winning books on games AI. Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of putting together your own GOAP API.

Alongside this, a simple hospital simulation will be constructed to test out the functionality of the library as it is put together.  The simulation will also rely on Unity's NavMesh System for navigation and path planning.\nThe course begins with an overview of Unity's NavMesh System and covers the basic functionality needed for the hospital simulation.  It then goes on to cover the concept of GOAP, where students will discover how goals, actions and plans interact.  A planner will be constructed that dynamically builds each character's sequence of actions, based on what they believe their goals are while in the simulation.\nFollowing this, inventories will be introduced and developed to hold resources for individual characters.  The resources in the inventories will be required for plan completion and also assist in directing a character's navigation around the environment.  This will then build to the design of more complex behaviours in which two characters must collaborate to complete a plan. \nAs the course continues, more characters with differing roles will be added and dynamically created and resources will be added and removed to develop a complex simulation.  By the end of the course, students will have a hospital simulation with patients, nurses, doctors and janitors each with their own roles, goals, actions and required resources. \nAlthough this course is not about building a completed game, a final section will provide some further knowledge on Unity development and examine methods for interacting with the environment such as: dragging and dropping items, dynamic NavMesh baking, user interface creation and camera movement to provide students with some direction on how such a simulation could be turned into a game.\nAt the completion of this course, students will have a fully-fledged GOAP library and API that they can reuse in their own game projects to provide game characters with complex intelligent behaviours.\nWhat students are saying about Penny's courses:\nWhat students are saying about Penny's courses:\nTurns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it.\nI honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!\nPenny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.\nTurns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it.\nTurns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it.\nTurns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it.\nI honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!\nI honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!\nI honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations!\nPenny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.\nPenny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.\nPenny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone interested in learning how to better program their own non-player characters (NPCs) for believable behaviour.\nAnyone wanting to learn the advanced AI technique of GOAP to control their sims.\nAnyone interested in seeing how artificial intelligence is applied in computer games.\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone interested in learning how to better program their own non-player characters (NPCs) for believable behaviour.\nAnyone wanting to learn the advanced AI technique of GOAP to control their sims.\nAnyone interested in seeing how artificial intelligence is applied in computer games.","number_of_lectures":"40 lectures","total_video_duration":"08:07:24","lectures_breakdown":[["Introduction","Preview\n04:08"],["Join the H3D Student Community","Preview\n01:15"],["FAQs","00:40"],["An Introduction to Navigation Meshes","Preview\n05:24"],["Setting up your own NavMesh","10:04"],["Moving an Agent Around the Mesh","13:35"],["GOAP Introduction","Preview\n05:22"],["Setting up a GOAP Environment","09:17"],["Preplanning the Agent Actions","08:16"],["The World States","12:59"],["Actions","11:58"],["Agents","08:13"],["The GOAP Planner Part 1","14:27"],["The GOAP Planner Part 2","12:44"],["Executing a Simple Plan","19:59"],["Creating a Multistep Plan","18:17"],["Plans that Require Multiple Agents","19:12"],["Adding More Resources to the World","18:08"],["Implementing an Inventory System","14:37"],["Moving the Nurse","07:25"],["Adding Goal Challenge","17:58"],["Taking a Break","09:19"],["Adding a Doctor Challenge","06:06"],["New Resource Models and Troubleshooting Part 1","16:47"],["New Resource Models and Troubleshooting Part 2","07:52"],["New Resource Challenge","13:28"],["Reusing Actions on Other Agents","19:38"],["A Little World Refactoring","16:55"],["Monitoring Agent States","14:47"],["Responding to a New Resource","09:17"],["Dragging and Dropping New Resources","13:03"],["Dynamic Navmesh Baking","11:59"],["Repositioning and Rotating Resources","17:09"],["Deleting a Resource","18:23"],["Refactoring for a Multi-resource UI","14:05"],["A UI to Work with Multiple Resources","19:59"],["Improved Repositioning","11:43"],["Moving the Camera","19:31"],["Some Final Words from Penny","02:09"],["Where to now?","11:16"]],"original_price":"$19.99","instructor_name":"Penny de Byl -&- Penny @Holistic3D.com","instructor_bio":"Hi, I'm Dr Penny de Byl.

Believe it or Not.\nThis course \"Digital Voice Cloning using Artificial Intelligence Tools\" created by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi Ranganathan\" primarily deals with explaining about a Montreal-based AI startup named \"Lyrebird\" which provides an online platform that, when trained on 30 or more recordings, can imitate a person's mimic speech. Lyrebird is an AI research division within Descript, currently and the team is building a new generation of tools for media editing and synthesis that make content creation more accessible and expressive.  Sounding to be a wow factor, this new neural voice cloning technology from Lyrebird (that is discussed in the course) synthesises the voice of a human from audio samples fed to it.\nWhat is Voice-Cloning and how this course can be the next big revolution in technology in 2020?\nWhat is Voice-Cloning and how this course can be the next big revolution in technology in 2020?\nVoice cloning corresponds to a few-shot generative speech modelling conditioned on the identity of the speaker.\nTypically, cloning a voice requires hours of recorded speech to build a dataset and then use the dataset to train a new voice model. Each speaker\u2019s embeddings can be applied to synthetically voice a random utterance or phrase - to be intact, or even users can input their own texts and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool will voice them. This means, the AI tool can voice words, sentences and phrases you have not even spoken at all, for that matter. But, this course depicts secrets that can in fact go a long way to change the world of sound for the better. no longer. New technology tools are on the rise and in fact - these groundbreaking Real-Time Voice Cloning Tools allow anyone to clone a voice from a set of audio samples. Some of these voice-cloning tools have recording capabilities in-built that you can use or leverage within the tool itself.\nThis course serves to be a game-changer this year and beyond as it allows you to replace recorded words and phrases with synthesised speech that's tonally blended with the surrounding audio - once the audio samples that you fed to it is finalised.

This program will help you build the foundation for a solid career in Machine learning Tools. Machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions.\nMachine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics; a discipline that also specializes in prediction-making. Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence through machines and mostly through computer systems. Artificial intelligence is a sub field of computer. It enables computers to do things which are normally done by human beings. This program is a comprehensive understanding of AI concepts and its application using Python and iPython.\nMachine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions. Machine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics; a discipline that also specializes in prediction-making.\nMachine learning is a subfield of computer science stemming from research into artificial intelligence. It has strong ties to statistics and mathematical optimization, which deliver methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit, rule-based algorithms is infeasible. Example applications include spam filtering, optical character recognition (OCR), search engines and computer vision. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining,] although that focuses more on exploratory data analysis. Machine learning and pattern recognition \u201ccan be viewed as two facets of the same field.\nMachine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you\u2019ll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems.\nMachine learning has proven to be a fruitful area of research, spawning a number of different problems and algorithms for their solution. This algorithm vary in their goals,in the available training data, and in the learning strategies. The ability to learn must be part of any system that would claim to possess general intelligence.\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone who wants to learn about Machine Learning.\nData Engineers, Software Engineers, Technical managers, Analysts, Architects, IT operations etc.\nData scientists, Researchers and Students\nThis course can be taken by anyone.

Then, this is the perfect course for you!\nAre you interested in understanding machine learning concepts and building real-time projects with R, but don\u2019t know where to start? Then, this is the perfect course for you!\nThe aim of machine learning is to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, and find useful information from data. In addition to this, through incorporation with data analysis, machine learning can be used to perform predictive analysis. With machine learning, the analysis of business operations and processes is not limited to human scale thinking; machine scale analysis enables businesses to capture hidden values in big data.\n\nMachine learning has similarities to the human reasoning process. Unlike traditional analysis, the generated model cannot evolve as data is accumulated. Machine learning can learn from the data that is processed and analyzed. In other words, the more data that is processed, the more it can learn.\nR, as a dialect of GNU-S, is a powerful statistical language that can be used to manipulate and analyze data. Additionally, R provides many machine learning packages and visualization functions, which enable users to analyze data on the fly. Most importantly, R is open source and free.\nUsing R greatly simplifies machine learning. All you need to know is how each algorithm can solve your problem, and then you can simply use a written package to quickly generate prediction models on data with a few command lines.\nBy taking this course, you will gain a detailed and practical knowledge of R and machine learning concepts to build complex machine learning models.  \n\n\n\nWhat details do you cover in this course?\nWhat details do you cover in this course?\n\nWe start off with basic R operations, reading data into R, manipulating data, forming simple statistics for visualizing data. We will then walk through the processes of transforming, analyzing, and visualizing the RMS Titanic data. You will also learn how to perform descriptive statistics.\nThis course will teach you to use regression models. We will then see how to fit data in tree-based classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, and so on.\nWe then move on to introducing powerful classification networks, neural networks, and support vector machines. During this journey, we will introduce the power of ensemble learners to produce better classification and regression results.\nWe will see how to apply the clustering technique to segment customers and further compare differences between each clustering method.\nWe will discover associated terms and underline frequent patterns from transaction data.\nWe will go through the process of compressing and restoring images, using the dimension reduction approach and R Hadoop, starting from setting up the environment to actual big data processing and machine learning on big data.\nBy the end of this course, we will build our own project in the e-commerce domain. \nThis course will take you from the very basics of R to creating insightful machine learning models with R.\nThis course will take you from the very basics of R to creating insightful machine learning models with R.\nWe have combined the best of the following Packt products:\nWe have combined the best of the following Packt products:\nR Machine Learning Solutions by Yu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu)\nMachine Learning with R Cookbook by Yu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu)\nR Machine Learning By Example  by Raghav Bali and Dipanjan Sarkar\nR Machine Learning Solutions by Yu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu)\nMachine Learning with R Cookbook by Yu-Wei, Chiu (David Chiu)\nR Machine Learning By Example  by Raghav Bali and Dipanjan Sarkar\n\n\nTestimonials:\nTestimonials:\nThe source content have been received well by the audience.

Each section contains a practice assignment for you to practically implement your learning.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-\nWhat is Machine Learning?\nWhat is Machine Learning?\nMachine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\nWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\nWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\nYou can divide your learning process into 3 parts:\nStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\nUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\nProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\nUnderstanding of  models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\nWhy use R for Machine Learning?\nWhy use R for Machine Learning?\nUnderstanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R\n1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.\n2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.\n3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.\n4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.\n5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.\nWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\nWhat is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?\nPut simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.\nDeep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.\nWho this course is for:\nPeople pursuing a career in data science\nWorking Professionals beginning their Data journey\nStatisticians needing more practical experience\nWho this course is for:\nPeople pursuing a career in data science\nWorking Professionals beginning their Data journey\nStatisticians needing more practical experience","number_of_lectures":"119 lectures","total_video_duration":"12:46:35","lectures_breakdown":[["Introduction","Preview\n02:35"],["Course resources: Notes and Datasets (Part 1)","00:10"],["Installing R and R studio","Preview\n05:52"],["Basics of R and R studio","10:47"],["Packages in R","10:52"],["Inputting data part 1: Inbuilt datasets of R","04:21"],["Inputting data part 2: Manual data entry","03:11"],["Inputting data part 3: Importing from CSV or Text files","06:49"],["Creating Barplots in R","13:43"],["Creating Histograms in R","06:01"],["Types of Data","04:04"],["Types of Statistics","02:45"],["Describing the data graphically","11:37"],["Measures of Centers","07:05"],["Measures of Dispersion","04:37"],["Introduction to Machine Learning","16:03"],["Building a Machine Learning Model","08:42"],["Quiz: Introduction to Machine Learning","4 questions"],["Gathering Business Knowledge","03:26"],["Data Exploration","03:19"],["The Data and the Data Dictionary","07:31"],["Importing the dataset into R","03:00"],["Univariate Analysis and EDD","03:34"],["EDD in R","12:43"],["Outlier Treatment","Preview\n04:15"],["Outlier Treatment in R","Preview\n04:49"],["Missing Value imputation","03:36"],["Missing Value imputation in R","03:49"],["Seasonality in Data","03:35"],["Bi-variate Analysis and Variable Transformation","16:14"],["Variable transformation in R","09:37"],["Non Usable Variables","04:44"],["Dummy variable creation: Handling qualitative data","04:50"],["Dummy variable creation in R","05:01"],["Correlation Matrix and cause-effect relationship","10:05"],["Correlation Matrix in R","08:09"],["The problem statement","01:25"],["Basic equations and Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) method","08:13"],["Assessing Accuracy of predicted coefficients","14:40"],["Assessing Model Accuracy -

The term used for cleaning data in data science circles is called data wrangling.  \ndetermined that 80%\ncleaning data.\ncleaning data in data science\ndata wrangling.\nIn this course we are going to learn Pandas using a lab integrated approach. Programming is something you have to do in order to master it. You can't read about Python and expect to learn it. \nPandas\nyou have to do\ncan't read about Python\ncan't read about Python\nPandas is the single most important library for data wrangling in Python. \nPandas\nsingle most important library\ndata wrangling\nPython\nData wrangling is the process of programmatically transforming data into a format that makes it easier to work with. \nprogrammatically transforming data into a format that makes it easier to work with. \n\nThis might mean modifying all of the values in a given column in a certain way, or merging multiple columns together. The necessity for data wrangling is often a byproduct of poorly collected or presented data. \nmodifying all of the values in a given column\nmerging multiple columns\nnecessity for data wrangling\npoorly collected or presented data.\nIn the real world data is messy. Very rarely do you have nicely cleansed data sets to point your supervised models against. \ndata is messy.\nrarely\nnicely cleansed data sets\nKeep in mind that 99% of all applied machine learning (real world machine learning) is supervised.

The growth potential career wise is second to none. You want the freedom to move anywhere you'd like. You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want to be able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on. Without a solid understanding of data wrangling in Python you'll have a hard time of securing a position as a machine learning engineer. \n2) Most of Machine Learning is Data Wrangling \n2) Most of Machine Learning is Data Wrangling \nIf you're new to this space the one thing many won't tell you is that much of the job of the data scientist and the machine learning engineer is massaging dirty data into a state where it can be modeled. In the real world data is dirty and before you can build accurate machine learning models you have to clean it. This process is called data wrangling and without this skills set you'll never get a job as a machine learning engineer.  This course will give you the fundamentals you need to cleanse your data. \n3) The Growth of Data is Insane \n3) The Growth of Data is Insane \nNinety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billion transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 exabytes a day. That number doubles every month.  Almost all real world machine learning is supervised. That means you point your machine learning models at clean tabular data. Python has libraries that are specific to data cleansing. \n4) Machine Learning in Plain English\n4) Machine Learning in Plain English\nMachine learning is one of the hottest careers on the planet and understanding the basics is required to attaining a job as a data engineer.  Google expects data engineers and their machine learning engineers to be able to build machine learning models. \n5) You want to be ahead of the Curve \n5) You want to be ahead of the Curve \nThe data engineer and machine learning engineer roles are fairly new.  While you\u2019re learning, building your skills and becoming certified you are also the first to be part of this burgeoning field.  You know that the first to be certified means the first to be hired and first to receive the top compensation package. \nThanks for interest in Data Wrangling in Pandas for Machine Learning Engineers\nData Wrangling in Pandas for Machine Learning Engineers\nSee you in the course!!\nWho this course is for:\nIf you're interested in becoming a machine learning engineer then this course is for you.\nIf you're interested in becoming a data engineer then this course is for you.\nIf you're a professional in any discipline that needs to become adept at data wrangling then this course is for you.\nWho this course is for:\nIf you're interested in becoming a machine learning engineer then this course is for you.\nIf you're interested in becoming a data engineer then this course is for you.\nIf you're a professional in any discipline that needs to become adept at data wrangling then this course is for you.","number_of_lectures":"89 lectures","total_video_duration":"01:45:26","lectures_breakdown":[["Introduction","Preview\n01:09"],["Is this Course for You?","Preview\n01:43"],["What is Pandas?","Preview\n01:06"],["What is Data Wrangling","Preview\n02:27"],["Summary","00:20"],["Quiz","5 questions"],["Common Interview Questions - Section 1","00:28"],["Download Raw Titanic Data Set","00:07"],["Load a Data Set in Pandas","Preview\n02:01"],["Data Types","01:20"],["Columns, Rows and Cells","01:31"],["Using Loc","01:17"],["iloc and ix","00:54"],["Subsetting Rows and Columns","01:44"],["Lab: Slicing Dataframes","01:48"],["Grouped and Aggregated Calculations","02:23"],["Grouped frequency counts","00:48"],["Lab: Grouping","01:59"],["Summary","01:03"],["Quiz","12 questions"],["Common Interview Questions - Section 2","00:52"],["The Series Object","01:24"],["Series Anatomy","01:08"],["Lab: Working with the Series Object","01:17"],["Attributes","00:55"],["An Array Defined","01:17"],["The Series and Numpy Array","01:00"],["Lab: Descriptive Statistics For pandas Dataframe","01:26"],["Boolean Subsetting with the Series","00:57"],["Vectorized Operations","01:29"],["Lab: Row Based Conditional Searches","01:25"],["Replacing Values in Pandas","00:40"],["Lab: Saving A Pandas Dataframe As A CSV","00:33"],["Rename Column Header In Pandas","00:33"],["Sorting Rows in a Pandas Dataframe","00:29"],["Read Excel Files","01:12"],["Regular Expression in Pandas","01:11"],["Binning Data","00:49"],["Normalize Data in Pandas","01:53"],["Lab: Data Normalization","01:10"],["Data Normalization Lab Line by Line","00:38"],["Summary","01:10"],["Quiz","10 questions"],["Common Interview Questions - Section 3","00:49"],["Install Seaborn Via Anaconda","00:35"],["Matplotlib","Preview\n02:13"],["Lab: Matplotlib Basics","01:51"],["Using Seaborn with a Pandas Dataframe","02:26"],["Lab: Seaborn Basics","01:13"],["Summary","00:28"],["Quiz","5 questions"],["Common Interview Questions - Section 4","00:36"],["File Concatenation","01:21"],["Row Concatenation","00:44"],["Lab: Concatenation","01:10"],["Merging","Preview\n01:54"],["Right, Left and Outer Joins","00:51"],["Lab: Merge Function","01:03"],["Summary","00:38"],["Quiz","8 questions"],["Common Interview Questions - Section 5","00:46"],["Evaluate Missing Data","01:53"],["Finding the NaNs","01:07"],["Dropping out Missing Values","01:39"],["Dropping Specific Cells","01:15"],["NaN Value Differences","00:59"],["Lab: Missing Data","01:29"],["Filling Using Index Values","00:45"],["Interpolation of missing values","01:19"],["Handling Duplicate Data","01:16"],["Lab: Duplicate Data","01:55"],["Mapping","01:21"],["The Replace Function","01:05"],["Using Functions to Create Columns","00:49"],["Lab: Breaking Up Strings","00:53"],["Summary","00:52"],["Quiz","10 questions"],["Common Interview Questions - Section 6","00:32"],["Time Series Basics","01:46"],["Timestamp Objects","01:10"],["Lab: Time Series","01:54"],["Timedelta","00:43"],["The DatetimeIndex","02:00"],["Force Datetime Function with Coerce","01:29"],["The Frequency Parameter","01:42"],["Frequency Table","00:02"],["The DateOffset","01:43"],["Built-in Date Offset Classes","00:04"],["Lab: DateOffset","01:41"],["Anchored Offsets","01:15"],["Period Object","02:02"],["Summary","00:53"],["Quiz","9 questions"],["Common Interview Questions - Section 7","00:44"],["Congratulations and Thank You!","00:26"],["Bonus Lecture \"Data Visualization in Python\"","00:15"]],"original_price":"$24.99","instructor_name":"Mike West","instructor_bio":"I've worked with databases for over two decades.

Given the amount of information in machine learning it is important to focus on important concepts and not get distracted.\nSecret 1\nnot to learn\n#Secret 2 - The requirement of maths and statistics is very shallow.  In general people think that to  master machine learning one needs to know lot of maths and statistics. That is not true. When it comes to applying machine learning, the knowledge of maths and statistics is limited.  The way to think about this to compare with knowledge of database indexes. You need to master the best practices of using database indexes. You don't need to know how databases indexes algorithms work. The same holds for machine learning concepts.\n\n#Secret 3  - The key skill to master machine learning is fine tuning. Any experienced ML expert will tell you that the maximum time that goes in taking machine learning problems to production  is optimisation. Hence ,is important to understand terms like overfitting ,underfitting sensitivity, specificity, precision, ROC, AUC. The course spends lot of time on these key fundamental concepts.\nSecret 2 -\n\n\nSecret 3  -\nAlso the likes of Google and  Amazon are producing tools like AutoML where the requirement of coding is close to  zero.

In this introductory lecture set of lectures I will give a very quick overview of the different kinds of machine learning paradigms and therefore I call this lectures machine learning. )\n\n\nA brief introduction with emphasis on brief right, so the rest of the course would be a more elongated introduction to machine learning right.\n\n\nSo what is machine learning so I will start off with a canonical definition put out by Tom Mitchell in 97 and so a machine or an agent I deliberately leave the beginning undefined because you could also apply this to non machines like biological agents so an agent is said to learn from experience with respect to some class of tasks right and the performance measure P if the learners performance tasks in the class as measured by P improves with experience.\n\n\nSo what we get from this first thing is we have to define learning with respect to a specific class of tasks right it could be answering exams in a particular subject right or it could be diagnosing patients of a specific illness right.\n\n\nSo but we have to be very careful about defining the set of tasks on which we are going to define this learning right, and the second thing we need is of a performance measure P right so in the absence of a performance measure P you would start to make vague statement like oh I think something is happening right that seems to be a change and something learned is there is some learning going on and stuff like that.\n\n\nSo if you want to be clearer about measuring whether learning is happening or not you first need to define some kind of performance criteria right.\n\n\nSo for example if you talk about answering questions in an exam your performance criterion could very well be the number of marks that you get or if you talk about diagnosing illness then your performance measure would be the number of patients that you say are the number of patients who did not have adverse reaction to the drugs you gave them there could be variety of ways of defining performance measures depending on what you are looking for right and the third important component here is experience right.\n\n\nSo with experience the performance has to improve right and so what we mean by experience here in the case of writing exams it could be writing more exams right so the more the number of exams you write the better you write it better you get it test taking or it could be a patient's in the case of diagnosing illnesses like the more patients that you look at the better you become at diagnosing illness right.\n\n\nSo these are the three components so you need a class of tasks you need a performance measure and you need some well-defined experience so this kind of learning right where you are learning to improve your performance based on experience is known as a this kind of learning where you are trying to where you learn to improve your performance with experience is known as inductive learning.\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the basis of inductive learning goes back several centuries people have been debating about inductive learning for hundreds of years now and are only more recently we have started to have more quantified mechanisms of learning right. So but one thing I always point out to people is that if you take this definition with a pinch of salt, so for example you could think about the task as fitting your foot comfortably right.\n\n\nSo you could talk about whether a slipper fits your foot comfortably or let me put so I always say that you should take this definition with a pinch of salt because take the example of a slipper you know, so the slipper is supposed to give protection to your foot right and a performance measure for the slipper would be whether it is fitting the leg comfortably or not or whether it is you know as people say there is biting your leg or is it\n\n\nChaffin your feet right and with experience you know as the slipper knows more and more about your foot as you keep varying the slipper for longer periods of time it becomes better at the task of fitting your foot right as measured by whether it is shattering your foot or whether it is biting your foot or not right.\n\n\nSo would you say that the slipper is learned to fit to your foot well by this definition yes right so we have to take this with a pinch of salt and so not every system that confirms to this definition of learning can be set to learn usually okay. (Refer Slide Time: 06:11) So going on so there are different machine learning paradigms that we will talk about and the first one is supervised learning where you learn an input to output map right so you are given some kind of an input it could be a description of the patient who comes to comes to the clinic and the output that have to produce is whether the patient has a certain disease or not so this they had to learn this kind of an input to output map or the input could be some kind of equation right and then output would be the answer to the question or it could be a true or false question I give you a description of the question you have to give me true or false as the output.\n\n\nAnd in supervised learning what you essentially do is on a mapping from this input to the required output right if the output that you are looking for happens to be a categorical output like whether he has a disease or does not have a disease or whether the answer is true or false then the supervised learning problem is called the classification problem right and if the output happens to be a continuous value like, so how long will this product last before it fails right or what is the expected rainfall tomorrow right so those kinds of problems they would be called as regression problems. These are supervised learning problems where the output is a continuous value and these are called as regression problems. So we will look at in more detail\nclassification and regression as we go on right, so the second class of problems are known as unsupervised learning problems right where the goal is not really to produce an output in response to an input but given a set of in data right we have to discover patterns in the data right. So that is more of the testicle unsupervised learning there is no real desired output that we are looking for right we are more interested in finding patterns in the data. So clustering right is one task one unsupervised learning task where you are interested\n\n\nin finding cohesive groups among the input pattern right, for example I might be looking at customers who come to my shop right and I want to figure out if there are categories of customers like so maybe college students could be one category and sewing IT professionals could be another category and so on so forth and when I'm looking at this kinds of grouping in my data, so I would call that a clustering task right.\n\n\nSo the other popular unsupervised learning paradigm is known as the Association rule mining or frequent pattern mining where you are interested in finding a frequent co-occurrence of items right in the data that is given to you so whenever A comes to my shop B also comes to my shop right. So those kinds of co-occurrence so I can always say that okay if I see A then there is likely very likely that B is also in my shop somewhere you know so I can learn these kinds of associations between data right. And again we look at this later in more detail\nthese are I mean there are many different variants on supervised and unsupervised learning but these are the main ones that we look at so the third form of learning which is called reinforcement learning it is neither supervised or unsupervised in nature and typically these are problems where you are learning to control the behavior of a system and I will give you more intuition intone enforcement learning now\nin one of the later modules, so like I said earlier. (Refer Slide Time: 09:33) So for every task right, so you need to have some kind of a performance measure so if you are looking at classification the performance measure is going to be classification error so typically right.\n\n\nSo we will talk about many, many different performance measures in the duration of this course but the typical performance measure you would want to use this classification error it's how many of the items or how many of the patients did I get incorrect so how many of them who are not having the disease today predict had the disease and how many of them that had the disease that I missed right. So that would be one of the\n\n\nmeasures that I would use and that would be the measure that we want to use but we will see later that often that is not is not possible to actually learn directly with respect to this measure. So we use other forms right and likewise for regression again so we have the prediction error suppose I say it is going to rain like 23 millimeters and then it ends up raining like 49centimeters I do not know so that is a huge prediction error right and in terms of clustering so this is little becomes a little trickier to define performance measures we don't\nknow what is a good clustering algorithm because we do not know what how to measure the quality of clusters.\n\n\nSo people come up with all different kinds of measures and so one of the more popular ones is a scatter or spread of the cluster that essentially tells you how spread out the points are that belong to a single group if you remember we are supposed to find cohesive groups, so if the group is not that cohesive it's not all of them are not together then you would say the clustering is of a poorer quality and if you have other ways of measuring things like Alec was telling you, so if you know that people are college students right and then you can figure out that how many what fraction of your cluster or college students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you can do this kinds of external evaluations so one measure that people use popularly there is known as purity right and in the Association rule mining we use variety of measures called support and confidence that takes a little bit of work to explain support in confidence so I will defer it and I talked about Association rules in detail and in more in the reinforcement learning tasks so if we remember I told you it is learning to control so you are going to have a cost for controlling the system and also the measure here is cost and you would\nlike to minimize the cost that you are going to accrue while controlling the system. So these are the basic machine learning tasks. (Refer Slide Time: 12:11) So there are several challenges when you are trying to build a build a machine learning solution right so a few of these I have listed on this slide right the first one is you have to think about how good is a model that you have learned right so I talked about a few measures on the previous slide but often those are not sufficient there are other practical considerations that come into play and\nwe will look at some of these towards thee there was a middle of the course somewhere right and the bulk of the time would be spent on answering the second question which is how do I choose a model right. So given some kind of data which will be the experience that we are talking about so given this experience how would I choose how would I choose a model right that somehow learns what I want to do right so how that improves itself with experience and so on so how do I choose this model and how do I actually find the parameters of the model that gives me the right answer right. So this is what we will spend much of our time on in this\n\n\ncourse and then there are a whole bunch of other things that you really have to answer to be able to build a useful machine loose full data analytics or data mining solutions questions like do I have enough data do I have enough experience to say that my model is good right it's the data efficient quality that could be errors in the data right suppose I have medical data and a is recorded as 225, so what does that mean it could be 225 days in which case it is a reasonable number it could be 22.5 years again is a reasonable number or 22.5 months is reasonable.\n\n\nBut if it is 225 years it's not a reasonable number so there is something wrong in the data right so how do you handle these things or noise in images right or missing values so I will talk briefly about handling missing values later in the course but this is as I mentioned in the beginning is a machine learning course right and this is not there is not primarily it is primarily concerned about the algorithms of machine learning and the and the math and the intuition behind those and not necessarily about the questions of building a practical\n\n\nsystems based on this. So I will be talking about many of these issues during the course but just that I want to reiterate that will not be the focus right and so the next challenge I have listed here is how confident can I be of the results and I want that I certainly we will talk a little bit because the whole premise of reporting machine learning results depends on how confident you can be of the results right and the last question am I describing the data correctly.\n\n\nSo that is a very, very domain dependent and the question that you can answer only with your experience as a machine learning or a data scientist professional or with time right, so but there are typical questions that you would like to ask that are there on the slides so from the next in the next module we look at the different learning paradigms in slightly more detail.\nIf you remember in supervised learning we talked about experience right where you have some kind of a description of the data. So in this case let us assume that I have a customer database and I am describing that by two attributes here, age and income.\n\n\nSo I have each customer that comes to my shop I know the age of the customer and the income level of the customers right. (Refer Slide Time: 00:48) And my goal is to predict whether the customer will buy a computer or not buy a computer right. So I have this kind of labeled data that is given to me for building a classifier right, remember we talked about classification where the output is a discrete value in this case it is yes or no, yes this is the person will buy a computer, no the person will not buy a computer.\n\n\nAnd the way I describe the input is through a set of attributes in this case we are looking at age and income as the attributes that describe the customer right. And so now the goal is to come up with a function right, come up with a mapping that will take the age and income as the input and it will give you an output that says the person will buy the computer or not buy the computer. So there are many different ways in which you can create this function and given that we are actually looking at a geometric interpretation of the data,\nI am looking at data as points in space. (Refer Slide Time: 01:57) The one of the most natural ways of thinking about defining this function is by drawing lines or curves on the input space right.\n\n\nSo here is one possible example, so here I have drawn a line and everything to the left of the line right. So these are points that are red right, so everything to the left of the line would be classified as will not buy a computer, everything to the right of the line where the predominantly the data points are blue will be classified as will buy a computer. So how would the function look like, it will look like something like if the income of a person remember that the x-axis is income and the y-axis is age.\n\n\nSo in this case it basically says that if the income of the person is less than some value right, less than some X then the person will not buy a computer. If the income is greater than X the person will buy your computer. So that is the kind of a simple function that we will define. It will just notice that way we completely ignore one of the variables here which is the age. So we are just going by income, if the income is less than some X then the person will not buy a computer, if the income is greater than X the person will buy a computer. So is this a good rule more or less I mean we get most of the points correct right except a few right.\n\n\nSo it looks like yeah, we can we can survive with this rule right. So this is not too bad right, but then you can do slightly better. (Refer Slide Time: 03:29) All right, so now we got those two red points that those just keep that points are on the wrong side of the line earlier. Now seem to be on the right side right, so\neverything to the left of this line will not buy a computer, everything to the right will buy a computer right, everyone moves to the right will buy a computer. So if you think about what has happened here, so we have improved our performance measure right. So the cost of something, so what is the cost here. So earlier we are only paying attention to the income right, but now we have to pay attention to the age as well right. So the older you are right, so the income threshold at which we will buy a computer is higher\nright. So the younger you are, younger means lower on the y axis, so the younger you are the income threshold at which you will buy a computer is lower right. So is that clear, so the older you are right, so the income threshold is shifted to the right here right so the older you are, so you need to have a higher income before you buy a computer and the anger you are your income threshold is lower, so you do not mind buying a computer even if your income is slightly lesser right.\n\n\nSo now we have to start paying attention to the age right, but then the advantage is you get much better performance right can you do better than this yes okay. (Refer Slide Time: 04:54) Now almost everything is correct except that one pesky red point, but everything else is correct. And so what has happened here we get much better performance, but at the cost of having a more complex classifier right. So earlier if you thought about it in geometric terms, so first you had a line that was parallel to the y-axis therefore, I just needed to define a intercept on the x-axis right. So if X is less than some value then it was one class was greater than some value was another class.\n\n\n\n\nThen the second function it was actually a slighting line like that, so I needed to define both the intercept and the slope right. And now here it is now a quadratic so I have to define three parameters right. So I have to define something like ax2+ bx+c, so I have defined the ABC the three parameters in order to find the quadratic, and I am getting better performance. So can you do better than this. (Refer Slide Time: 05:57)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay the sum for does not seem right correct seems to be too complex a function just to be getting this one point there right. And I am not sure I am not even sure how many parameters you need for drawing that because Microsoft use some kind of spline PowerPoint use some kind of spline interpolation to draw this curve I am pretty sure that it is lot, lot more parameters than it is worth another thing to note here is that that particular red point that you see is actually surrounded by a sea of blue right. So it is quite likely that there was some glitch there either the person actually bought a computer and we never we have not recorded it has been having what computer or there are some extremist reason the person comes into the shop sure that is going to buy a computer but then gets a phone call saying that some emergency please come out immediately and therefore he left without buying a computer right there could be variety of reasons for why that noise occurred and this will probably be the more appropriate classifier right. So these are the kinds of issues I would like to think about what is the complexity of the classifier that I would like to have right and versus the accuracy of the classifier, so how good\n\n\nis the classifier in actually recovering the right input output map and or their noise data in the in the input in the experience that I am getting is it clean or is there noise on it and if so how do I handle that noise these are the kinds of issues that we have to look at okay. (Refer Slide Time: 07:31) So these kinds of lines that we drew right kind of hiding one assumption that we are making so the thing is the data that comes to me comes as discrete points in the space right and from these discrete points in the space I need to generalize and be able to say something about the entire state space right so I do not care where the data point is on the x and y-axis right I should be able to give a label to that right. If I do not have some kind of assumption about these lines right and if you do not have some kind of assumptions about these lines the only thing I can do is if the same customer comes again hey or somebody who has exact same age and income as that cause customer comes again I can tell you whether the person is going to buy a computer or not buy a computer but I will not be able to tell you about anything else outside of the experience right. So the assumption we made is everything to the left of a line is going to do one thing or the other right so everything to the left of the line will not buy the computer everything to the right or everyone to the right will buy a computer this is an assumption I made the assumption was the Lions are able to segregate people who buy from who do not buy the lines or the curves were able to segregate people who will buy from who will not buy so that is a kind of an assumption I made about the distribution of the input data and the class labels. So this kind of assumptions that we make about these lines are known as inductive biases in general inductive bias has like two different categories one is called language bias which is essentially the type of lines that I am going to draw my gonna draw straight lines or am I going to draw curves and what order polynomials am I going to look at and so on so forth these for my language bias and such bias is the other form of inductive bias that tells me how in what order am I going to examine all these possible lines right\n\n\n\n\n. So that gives me the gives me a search bias right, so putting these two these things together we are able to generalize from a few training points to the entire space of inputs right I will make this more formal as we go on and then in the next night set of modules right. (Refer Slide Time: 10:01) And so here is one way of looking at the whole process so I am going to be giving you a set of data which we will call the training set so the training set will be will consists of say as an input which we'll call as X and an output which we call as Y right, so I am going to have a set of inputs I have X1, X2, X3, X4 likewise I will have Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4 and t\nhis data is fed into a training this data is fed into a training algorithm right and so the data is going to look like this in our case right. So remember our X\u2019s are the input variable success all the inputs so in this case that should have the income and the age, so x1 is like 30,000 and 25 and x2 is like 80,000 and 45 and so on so forth and the Y's or the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabels they correspond to the colors in the previous picture right so y1 does not buy a computer Y2 buys a computer and so on so forth so this essentially gives me the color coding so y1 is essentially red and y2 is blue right and I really if I am going to use something numeric this is what we will be doing later on I really cannot be using these values first of all wise or not numeric and the X is varied too much right. So the first coordinate in the X is like 30,000 and 80,000 and so on so forth and the second coordinate is like 25 and 45 so that is a lot a lot smaller in magnitude so this will lead to some kind of numerical instabilities, so what will typically end up doing is normalizing these so that they form appropriate approximately in the same range so you can see that I have try to normalize these X values between 0 and 1 right.\n\n\n\n\nSo have chosen an income level of say 2 lakhs it is the maximum and age of 100 and you can see the normalized values and likewise for buys and not buy I have taken not by as - 1 and by as computer is + 1these are arbitrary choices, now but later on you will see that there are specific reasons for wanting to choose this encoding in this way alright and then the training algorithm chugs over this data right and it will produce a classifier so now this classifier I do not know I do not know whether it is good or bad right so we had a straight line in the first case right an axis parallel line if we did not know the good or bad and we needed to have some mechanism by which we evaluate this right. So how do we do the evaluation typically is that you have what is\n\n\ncalled a test set or a validation set right so this is another set of x and y paths like we had in the training set, so again in the test set we know what the labels are it is just that we are not showing it to the training algorithm we know what the labels are because we need to use the correct labels to evaluate whether your trading algorithm is doing good or bad right so, so this process by which this evaluation happens is called validation later then of the validation. If you are happy with the quality of the classifier we can keep it if you are not happy they go back to the training algorithm and say hey I am not happy with what you produced give me something different right, so we have to either iterate over the algorithm again we will go over the data again and try to refine the parameter estimation or we could even think of changing some parameter values and then trying to redo the training algorithm all over again but this is the general process and we will see that many of the different algorithms that we look, look at in the course of fitting the course of these lectures actually follow this kind of a process okay so what happens inside that green box. (Refer Slide Time: 13:48) So inside the training algorithm is that there will be this learning agent right which will take an input and it will p\n\n\nroduce an output white at which it thinks is the correct output right but it will compare it against the actual target why it was given for the in the training right, so in the training you actually have a target why so it will compare it against a target why right and then figure out what the error is and use the error to change the agent right so then it can produce the right output next time around this is essentially an iterative process so you see that input okay produce an output Y ha\n\n\nt and then you take the target Y. You can compare it to the Y hat figure out what is the error and use the error to change the agent again right and this is by and large the way most of the learning all algorithms will operate most of the classification algorithms or even regression algorithms will open it and we will see how each of this works as, we go on right there are many, many applications. (Refer Slide Time: 14:46) I mean this is too numerous to list here are a few examples you could look at say a fraud detection right, so we have\nsome data where the input is a set of transactions made by a user and then you can flag each transaction as a valid transaction or not you could look at sentiment analysis you know varied Lee called opinion mining or buzz analysis etc. Where I give you a piece of text or a review written about and a product or a movie and then you tell me whether the movies whether the review is positive or whether is negative and what are the negative points that people are mentioning about and so on so forth and. This again a classification task or you could use it for doing churn prediction where you are going to say whether a customer who is in the system is likely to leave your system is going to continue using your product or using your service for a longer period of time, so this is essentially churn so when a person leaves your services you call the person earner and you can label what the person is Channel or not and I have been giving you examples form medical diagnosis all through apart from actually diagnosing whether a person has the disease or not you could also use it for risk analysis in the slightly indirect way I talked about that when we when we do the algorithms for classification. So we talked about how we are interested in learning different lines or curves that can separate different classes in supervised learning and, so this curves can be represented using different structures and throughout the course we will be looking at different kinds of learning mechanisms like artificial neural networks support vector machines decision trees nearest neighbors and Bayesian networks and these are some of the popular ones and we look at these in more detail as the course progresses so another supervised learning problem is the one of prediction. (Refer Slide Time: 16:45) Or regression where the output that you are going to pred\n\n\nict is no longer a discrete value it is not like we will buy a computer whereas not buy a computer it is more of a continuous value so here is an example, where at different times of day you have recorded the temperature so the input to the system is going to be the time of day and the output from the system is going to be the temperature that was measured at a particular point at the time right so you are going to get your experience or your training data is going to take this form so the blue points woul\n\n\nd be your input and the red points would be the outputs that you are expected to predict. So note here that the outputs are continuous or real value right and so you could think of this in this toy example as points to the left being day and the points to the right being night right and just as in the previous case of classification, so we could try to do these simple as possible fit in this case which would be to draw a straight line that is as close as possible to these points now you do see that like in the classification case when it choose a simple solution there are certain points at which we are making large errors right so we could try to fix that.\n\n\n\n\nAnd try to do something more fancy but you can see that while the daytime temperatures are more or less fine with the night times we seem to be doing something really off right because we are going off too much to thee the right-hand side all right how are you could do something more complex just like in the classification case where we wanted to get that one point right so we could try and fit all these temperatures that were given to us by looking at a sufficiently complex curve. And again this as we discussed earlier is probably not the right answer and you are probably in this case surprisingly or better off fitting the straight line rig\n\n\nht and so these kinds of solutions where we trying to fit the noise in the data we are trying to make the solution predict the noise in the training data correctly are known as over fitting over fit solut\n\n\n\n\n\n\nions and one of the things that we look to avoid in, in machine learning is to over fit to the training data. (Refer Slide Time: 19:21) So we will talk about this again and then new course right and so what we do is typically we would like to do what is called linear regression some of you might have come across this and of different circumstances and the typical aim in linear regression is to say take the error that your line is making so if you take an example point let us say I take any let us say I take an example point somewhere here righ\n\n\nt. So this is the actual training data that is given to you and this is the prediction that your line is making at this point so this quantity is essentially the, the prediction error that this line is making and so what you do is you try to find that line that has the least prediction error right so you take the square of the errors that your prediction is making and then you try to minimize the, the sum of the squares of the errors why do we take the squares. (Refer Slide Time: 20:31) Because errors could be both positive or negative and we want to make sure that you are minimizing that regardless of the sign of the error okay and so with sufficient data right so a linear regression is simple enough you could just already using matrix inversions as we will see later but with many dimensions like the challenge is to avoid\n\n\nover fitting like we talked about earlier and then there are many ways of avoiding this. And so I will again talk about this in detail when we look at linear regression\n\n\nright so one point that I want to make is that linear regression is not as simple as it sounds right so here is an example so I have two input variables x1 and x2 right and if I try to fit a straight line with x1 and x2 I will probably end up with something like a1 x1 plus a2 x2 right and that looks like, like a plane in two dimensions right. But then if I just take these two dimensions and then transform them transform the input so instead of saying just the x1 and x2 if I say my input is going to look like x1 square x2 squared x1 x2 and then the x1 and x2 s it was in the beginning so instead of looking at a two-dimensional input if I am going to look at a 5 dimensional input right. So that wil\n\n\nl and out now I am going to fit a line or a linear plane in this 5 dimensional input so that will be like a1 x1 squared plus a2 x2 square plus a3 x1 x2 plus a4 x1 plus a5 x2 now that is no longer the equation of a line in two dimensions right so that is the equation of a second-order polynomial in two dimensions but I can still think of this as doing linear regression because I am only fitting a function that is going to be linear in the input variables right so by choosing an appropriate transformation of the inputs. (Refer Slide Time: 22:38) I can fit any higher-order function so I could solve very complex problems using linear regression and so it is not really a weak method as you would think at first, first glance again we will\n\n\nlook at this in slightly more detail in the later lectures right and regression our prediction can be applied in a variety of places one popular places in time series prediction you could think about predicting rainfall in a certain region or how much you are going to spend on your telephone calls you could think of doing even classification using this.\n\n\n\n\nIf you think of you remember our encoding of plus 1 and minus 1 for the class labels so you could think of plus 1 and minus 1 as the outputs right and then you can fit a regression line regression curve to that and if the output is greater than 0 you would say this classis plus 1 its output is less than 0 you see the class is minus 1 so it could use the regression ideas to fitness will solve the classificat\nion problem and you could also do data addiction. So I really do not want to you know give you all the millions of data points that I have in my data set but what I would do is essentially fit the curve to that and then give you just the coefficients of the curve right. And more often than not that is sufficient for us to get a sense of the data and that brings us to the next application I have listed their which is trend analysis so I am not really interested in quite many times. I\n\n\n\n\n\n\nam not interested in the actual values of the data but more in the, the trends so for example I have a solution that I am trying to measure the running times off and I am not really interested in the actual running time because with 37seconds to 38 seconds is not going to tell me much. But I would really like to know if the running time scales linearly or exponentially with the size of the important all right so those kinds of analysis again can be done using regression and in the last one here is again risk factor analysis like we had in classification and you can look at which are the factors that contribute most to the output so that brings us to the end of this module on supervised learning,,\nHello and welcome to this module on introduction to unsupervised learning, right. So in supervised learning we looked at how you will handle training data that had labels on it. (Refer Slide Time: 00:26) So this is this particular place this is a classification data set where red denotes one class and blue denotes the other class right. (Refer Slide Time: 00:35) And in unsupervised learning right so you basically have a lot of data that is given to you but they do not have any labels attached to them right so we look at first at the problem of clus\n\n\ntering where your goal is to find groups of coherent or cohesive data points in this input space right so here is an example of possible clusters. (Refer Slide Time: 00:57) So those set of data points could form a cluster right and again now those set of data points could form a cluster and again those and those so there are like four clusters that we have identified in this in this setup so one thing to note here is that even in something like clustering so I need to have some form of a bias right so in this case the bias that I am having is in the shape of the cluster so I am assuming that the clusters are all ellipsoids right and therefore you know I have been drawing a specific shape curves for representing the clusters.\n\n\n\n\nAnd also note that not all data points need to fall into clusters and there are a couple of points there that do not fall into any of the clusters this is primarily a artifact of me assuming that they are ellipsoids but still there are other points in the center is actually faraway from\n\n\nall the other points in the in the data set to be considered as what are known as outliers so when you do clustering so there are two things so one is you are interested in finding cohesive groups of points and the second is you are also interested in finding data points that do not conform to the patterns in the input and these are known as outliers all right. (Refer Slide Time: 02:23) And that is as many mean different ways of an which you can accomplish clustering and we will look at a few in the course and the applications are numerous right so here are a few representative ones so one thing is to look at customer data right and try to discover the classes of customers you kno\n\n\nw there are so earlier we looked at in the supervised learning case we looked at is that a customer will buy a computer or will not buy a computer as opposed to that we could just take all the customer data that you have and try to just group them into different kinds\n\n\nof customers who come to your shop and then you could do some kind of targeted promotions and different classes of customers right. And this need not\n\n\nnecessarily come with labels you know I am not going to tell you that okay this customer is class 1 that customer is class 2 you are just going to find out which of the customers are more similar with each other all right. And as the second application which you have illustrated here is that I could do clustering on image pixels so that you could discover different regions in the image and then you could do some segmentation based on that different region so for example here it have a picture of a picture of a beach scene and then you are able to figure out the clouds and the sand and the sea and the tree from the image so that allows you to make more sense out of the image right.\n\n\n\n\nOr you could do clustering on world usages right and you could discover synonyms and you could also do clustering on documents right and depending on which kind of documents are similar to each other and if I give you a collection of say 100,000 documents I might be able to figure out what are the different topics that are discussed in this collection of documents and many ways in which you can use clustering rule mining. (Refer Slide Time: 04:17)\n\n\nAnd as I should give you a site about the usage of the word mining here so many of you might have heard of the term data mining and more often than not the purported data mining tasks are essentially machine learning problems right so it could be classification regression and so on so forth and the first problem that was essentially introduced as a mining problem and not as a learning problem was the one of mining frequent patterns and associations and that is one of the reasons\n\n\nI call this Association rule mining as opposed to Association rule learning just to keep the historic connection intact right, so in Association rule mining we are interested in finding frequent patterns that occur in the input data and then we are looking at conditional dependencies among these patterns right.\n\n\nAnd so for example if A and B occur together often right then I could say something like if A happens then B will happen let us suppose that so you have customers that are coming to your shop and whenever customer A visits your shop custom B also tags along with him right, so the next time you find customary\n\n\nA somewhere in the shop so you can know that customer B is already there in the shop along with A. Or with very high confidence you could say that B is also in the shop at some somewhere else maybe not with A but somewhere else in the shop all right, so these are the kinds of rules that we are looking at Association rules which are conditional dependencies if A has come then B is also there right and so the Association rule mining process usually goes in two stages so the first thing is we find all frequent patterns. So A happens often so A is a customer that comes to measure the store often right and then I find that A and B are paths of customers that come to my store often so if I once I have that right A comes to my store often an A and B comes to my store often then I can derive associations from this kind this frequent patterns right and also you could do this in the variety of different settings you could find sequences in time series data right and where you could look at triggers for certain events. Or you could look at fault analysis right by looking at a sequence of events that happened and you can figure out which event occurs more often with the fault right or you could look at transactions data which is the most popular example given here is what is called Market Basket data so you go to a shop and you buy a bunch of things together and you put them in your basket so what is there in your basket right so this forms the transaction so you buy say eggs, milk and bread and so all of this go together in your basket. And then you can find out what are the frequently occurring patterns in this purchase data and\n\n\nthen you can make rules out of those or you could look at finding patterns and graphs that is typically used in social network analysis so which kind of interactions among entities happen often right so that is a that is another question that is what we looking at right. (Refer Slide Time: 07:31) So the most popular thing here is mining transactions so the most popular application here is mining transactions and as I mentioned earlier transaction is a collection o\n\n\nf items that are bought together right and so here is a little bit of terminology and it is a set or a subset of items is often called an item set in the Association rule mining community and so the first step that you have to do is find fre\n\n\nquent item sets right. And you can conclude that item set A if it is frequent implies item set B if both A and AUB or frequent item sets right so A and B are subset so AUB is another subset so if both A and AUB or frequent item sets then you can say that item set A implies item set B right and like I mentioned earlier so there are many applications here so you could think of predicting co-occurrence of events. (Refer Slide Time: 08:31) And Market Basket analysis and type series analysis like I mentioned earlier you could think of trigger events or false causes of False and so on so forth right so this brings us to the end of this module introducing unsupervised learning.\n\n\nit is a 30 day refund period!!

People across different disciplines are trying to apply AI to make their tasks a lot easier. For example, economists are using AI to predict future market prices to make a profit, doctors use AI to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign, meteorologists use AI to predict the weather, HR recruiters use AI to check the resume of applicants to verify if the applicant meets the minimum criteria for the job, etcetera. The impetus behind such ubiquitous use of AI is machine learning algorithms. For anyone who wants to learn ML algorithms but hasn\u2019t gotten their feet wet yet, you are at the right place. The rudimental algorithm that every Machine Learning enthusiast starts with is a linear regression algorithm. Therefore, we shall do the same as it provides a base for us to build on and learn other ML algorithms.\nBefore knowing what is linear regression, let us get ourselves accustomed to regression. Regression is a method of modeling a target value based on independent predictors. This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out the cause and effect relationship between variables. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\nWant to learn more about regression?

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\nWhat is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\nWhat is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\nLinear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.\nLinear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).\nWhen there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.\nWhen there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.\nWhy learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\nWhy learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?\nThere are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:\n1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique\n2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy\n3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret\n4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning\nHow much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?\nHow much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?\nLinear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.\nWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\nWhat are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?\nYou can divide your learning process into 4 parts:\nStatistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.\nUnderstanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model\nProgramming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python\nUnderstanding of Linear and Logistic Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear and Logistic Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.\nWhy use Python for data Machine Learning?\nWhy use Python for data Machine Learning?\nUnderstanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.\nThough it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:\n    In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.\n    In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.\n    In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.\nMachine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.\n\n\nWho this course is for:\nPeople pursuing a career in data science\nWorking Professionals beginning their Data journey\nStatisticians needing more practical experience\nAnyone curious to master Linear and Logistic Regression from beginner to advanced level in a short span of time\nWho this course is for:\nPeople pursuing a career in data science\nWorking Professionals beginning their Data journey\nStatisticians needing more practical experience\nAnyone curious to master Linear and Logistic Regression from beginner to advanced level in a short span of time\nPeople pursuing a career in data science","number_of_lectures":"65 lectures","total_video_duration":"08:15:41","lectures_breakdown":[["Introduction","Preview\n03:26"],["Installing Python and Anaconda","Preview\n03:04"],["Course Resources","00:03"],["Opening Jupyter Notebook","Preview\n09:06"],["Introduction to Jupyter","13:26"],["Arithmetic operators in Python: Python Basics","04:28"],["Strings in Python: Python Basics","19:07"],["Lists, Tuples and Directories: Python Basics","18:41"],["Working with Numpy Library of Python","11:54"],["Working with Pandas Library of Python","09:15"],["Working with Seaborn Library of Python","08:57"],["Types of Data","Preview\n04:04"],["Types of Statistics","02:45"],["Describing data Graphically","11:37"],["Measures of Centers","07:05"],["Measures of Dispersion","04:37"],["Gathering Business Knowledge","03:26"],["Data Exploration","03:19"],["The Dataset and the Data Dictionary","07:31"],["Importing Data in Python","06:04"],["Univariate analysis and EDD","03:34"],["EDD in Python","12:11"],["Outlier Treatment","04:15"],["Outlier Treatment in Python","14:18"],["Missing Value Imputation","03:36"],["Missing Value Imputation in Python","04:57"],["Seasonality in Data","03:35"],["Bi-variate analysis and Variable transformation","16:14"],["Variable transformation and deletion in Python","09:21"],["Non-usable variables","04:44"],["Dummy variable creation: Handling qualitative data","04:50"],["Dummy variable creation in Python","05:45"],["Correlation Analysis","10:05"],["Correlation Analysis in Python","07:07"],["The Problem Statement","Preview\n01:25"],["Basic Equations and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method","08:13"],["Assessing accuracy of predicted coefficients","14:40"],["Assessing Model Accuracy: RSE and R squared","07:19"],["Simple Linear Regression in Python","14:07"],["Multiple Linear Regression","04:57"],["The F - statistic","08:22"],["Interpreting results of Categorical variables","05:04"],["Multiple Linear Regression in Python","14:13"],["Test-train split","09:32"],["Bias Variance trade-off","06:01"],["Test train split in Python","10:19"],["The Dataset and the Data Dictionary","08:14"],["Data Import in Python","04:56"],["EDD in Python","18:01"],["Outlier Treatment in Python","09:53"],["Missing Value Imputation in Python","04:49"],["Variable transformation and Deletion in Python","04:55"],["Dummy variable creation in Python","05:45"],["Why can't we use Linear Regression?","04:32"],["Logistic Regression","07:54"],["Training a Simple Logistic Model in Python","12:25"],["Result of Simple Logistic Regression","05:11"],["Logistic with multiple predictors","02:22"],["Training multiple predictor Logistic model in Python","06:05"],["Confusion Matrix","03:47"],["Creating Confusion Matrix in Python","09:55"],["Evaluating performance of model","07:40"],["Evaluating model performance in Python","02:22"],["Test-Train Split","09:30"],["Test-Train Split in Python","06:46"]],"original_price":"$94.99","instructor_name":"Start-Tech Academy","instructor_bio":"Start-Tech Academy is a technology-based Analytics Education Company and aims at Bringing Together the analytics companies and interested Learners. \nOur top quality training content along with internships and project opportunities helps students in launching their Analytics journey.\nFounded by Abhishek Bansal and Pukhraj Parikh.\nWorking as a Project manager in an Analytics consulting firm, Pukhraj has multiple years of experience working on analytics tools and software.

There are two main types of researches: quantitative research and qualitative research. If you look at the most of the researchers around yourself, their skills are often limited to quantitative research tools. This is mainly because qualitative researchers are still not part of the curriculum of many universities and institutions around the world. In case qualitative researchers are taught at masters or doctoral level they are presented in a very complex and esoteric manner making it very difficult for the students to comprehend the method of qualitative research. Research is all about methods and innovative ideas. You will always feel handicapped unless and until you learn the techniques on your own by right guidance and constant practice.\nOften in the name of qualitative research, many people analyze their data in a vague and subjective manner. My method is to use qualitative software for teaching qualitative analysis. This is because software are based on logical steps and any analysis learned through them makes the learning clear and concrete.

Throughout human history, computing power was a scarce resource. However, with the recent advent of global scale cloud computing, high-end computing is now available to organizations of almost all size at low cost and on-demand.\nThe third major element that has fallen into place is a powerful new set of algorithmic approaches. Breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning in particular now provide the software systems to process these ever more complex data sets; algorithms that learn from data, that can deal with millions of parameters, that can coordinate vast digital platforms, optimizing logistics networks, automating financial trades, predicting maintenance on electrical grids.\nNew Instrument\nNew Instrument\nWith these new tools, we are now peering into massive unstructured data sets using ever more sophisticated algorithmic frameworks to see what we could never before see. Many compare this to building a new kind of microscope or telescope. But whereas with the microscope we revealed the microscopic mysteries of life and with the telescope the stars and galaxies, this tool lets us see the complex systems all around us.\nData is opening up our ability to perceive things around us that were previously invisible; our evolved social, economic and technological systems that have become so complex we can no longer see them are being revealed to us in new ways. The implications of this are huge; just as the telescope changed our understanding of our place in the universe, complex analytics is changing our understanding of the world around us, the systems we form part of and this opens the door to a shift in the nature of how we make decisions and management is conducted.\nMore and more governments, business sectors, and institutions begin to realize data is becoming the most valuable asset and its analysis is becoming core to competitiveness. Today data is becoming a new universal language, mastering it can win sports matches, can make movies a success, can win elections, can build smart cities, can make the right trade at the right time, it may even win wars.\nThis course explores the world of complex data analytics: information systems that are able to analyze big data and transform these restless streams of data into insight, decisions, and action. Complex analytics focuses on how we extract the data from a complex system - such as a financial market, a transport network or a social network - and process that into meaningful patterns and actionable insights.\nBig Data\nBig Data\nAfter starting the course with an overview to the subject we will look at the emergence of big data and the expanding universe of dark data; we talk about the ongoing process of datafication, the quantification of more and more aspects of our lives and the many issues that it brings with respect to privacy.\nAdvanced Algorithms\nAdvanced Algorithms\nIn the second section, we will talk about the rise of algorithms as they are coming to effect ever more spheres of our world. We will introduce you to the workings of machine learning systems and the different approaches used, we go more in-depth on neural networks and deep learning before assessing the limitations of algorithms.\nSmart Systems\nSmart Systems\nThe third section is dedicated to smart systems, as the convergence of machine learning with the internet of things is beginning to populate our world with systems that exhibit adaptive and responsive behavior, which are autonomous and can interact with humans in a natural way. Here we look at cyber-physical systems, smart platforms, and autonomous systems before discussing security issues.\nData Driven Organizations\nData Driven Organizations\nThe final section deals with the relationship between people and technology and the emergence of a new form of analytics and data-driven networked organization. We talk about the fundamental distinction between synthetic and analytical reasoning as a way of understanding the distinction between digital computation and human reasoning and as a means for interpreting the rapidly evolving relationship between the two.\nThis is not a technical course where you will learn the details of data modeling or how to build machine learning systems. What it does provide is an overview of this very exciting and important new area that will be of relevance to almost all domains, researchers, engineers and designers, business and the general public alike.\nThe course aims to be a comprehensive overview to complex analytics, it aims to be inclusive in scope. We try to provide an understanding of the context to these major technological developments; a conceptual understanding of the methods and approaches of big data modeling and analysis; an overview to the underlying technology and address the issues and consequences both positive and negative of such technological developments.\nWho this course is for:\nAnyone who wants to learn more about advanced analytics and big data and their implications for society and economy","number_of_lectures":"22 lectures","total_video_duration":"03:09:56","lectures_breakdown":[["Complex Data Analytics Introduction","Preview\n15:56"],["Data Analytics","Preview\n07:59"],["Complex Analytics Overview","10:06"],["Datafication","08:02"],["Big Data Explained","11:40"],["Dark Data Analytics","07:56"],["Data Driven Decisions","07:34"],["Dataism","11:35"],["Data Privacy","09:18"],["The Rise of Algorithms","13:00"],["Machine Learning Overview","08:43"],["Machine Learning Approaches","08:20"],["Neural Nets","08:04"],["Deep Learning Overview","06:46"],["Limitations of Algorithms","12:47"],["Smart Systems","05:09"],["Smart Platforms","09:13"],["Autonomous Agents","04:45"],["Smart Systems Security","08:03"],["Data Driven Organizations","05:41"],["What is DIKW?","02:18"],["Human-Machine Relation","06:59"]],"original_price":"$49.99","instructor_name":"Systems Innovation","instructor_bio":"Systems Innovation is an online platform dedicated to the area of complex systems and systems change, our mission is to take the world of complexity and make it accessible to all.
